In lexical terms Akkadian is one of the largest Semitic languages. It possesses a
vast vocabulary of Semitic words augmented by borrowings from other languages,
both Semitic and unrelated. During its long history the various dialects of Akkadian
absorbed many foreign words from the several tongues with which, at one or other
time and place, they shared speakers and writers. These were chiefly Sumerian,
Amorite, Hurrian, Aramaic, Old Persian and Greek. The first four, especially, were
much spoken in parts of the Akkadian linguistic area. Bilingualism in Akkadian and
one of these other languages is a conspicuous feature of the linguistic history of
ancient Mesopotamia.

The vocabulary of Akkadian is still in the process of elucidation, for while we
now possess either complete or nearly so two exhaustive modern dictionaries
(Wolfram von Soden's Akkadisches Handworterbuch and the Assyrian Dictionary of
the University of Chicago), the exact meaning of many words last spoken two
millennia ago continues to give difficulty. The process of refinement of our
understanding of the Akkadian lexical stock will continue to exercise linguists and
philologists for many generations. Akkadian was also a very long-lived language.
Varieties of Akkadian were spoken in what is now Iraq from at least the middle of the
3rd millennium to the middle of the 1st millennium BC, and a written form of the
language continued in use until the 1st century AD, perhaps even later.

A consequence of the long history of Akkadian, and the durability of the clay
tablets on which it was written, is that we possess an enormous body of Akkadian
texts. These texts fall into of all kinds of different categories and document a huge
range of human activities and intellectual pursuits (Table 1). Three principal avenues
of research stretch out before the Assyriologist as a result. First, the superabundance
of letters and other archival documents permits the reconstruction of ancient
institutions and societies with a detail that is impossible for many periods of more
recent civilizations, including much of medieval Europe. The existence of multiple
manuscripts of texts passed down in the scribal tradition holds out hope for the
eventual recovery of the entire corpus of lst-millennium Babylonian literature and
Sumero-Babylonian scholarly achievement, alongside the earlier 2nd-millennium
Sumerian corpus. Finally, the considerable variation in dialects of Akkadian over
time and space (Table 2) offers lexicographers and historical grammarians almost
unlimited scope for diachronic and synchronic linguistic study.

These prospects of new knowledge make competence in Akkadian an exciting
tool to possess. It is not possible here to describe all avenues of research in Akkadian,
nor to cover every aspect of Akkadian as a language. Others have written brief
summaries of Akkadian grammar (Bergstrasser 1983: 25-49, Campbell 1991: 32-6,
Bucceliati 1997, Huehnergard and Woods 2004). One more would seem superfluous.
Instead of adding to their number, it is enough here to draw attention to three salient





features of Akkadian that distinguish it from most other Semitic: (a) the range of
consonants is sharply reduced, probably under the influence of Sumerian, (b) word
order in prose is subject - object - verb (SOV) as in Sumerian (Semitic is usually
VSO), and (c) the verbal conjugations are put to uses different from their counterparts
in other Semitic. Here the purpose is rather to examine the history and development
of Akkadian based on current knowledge. What emerges is an account of the spread
and usage of Akkadian: who spoke it, who wrote it, where, when and for what
purpose.

This history is not definitive, however, for there is a caveat. Even in later
periods, written forms of language tend to favour one variety of the language over
another and so hide from us the full picture of dialectal diversity. When we also take
into account the sporadic and uneven nature of the extant documentation, both in time
and space, it will be obvious that any current history of Akkadian and its dialects will
be provisional. New discoveries will force regular revisions.



Akkadian and Akkade

The adjective akkadum "Akkadian" derives from the place name Akkade (in older
literature Agade). Akkade was the ancient capital of the dynasty founded by S argon,
whose kings were the first to make extensive use of written Akkadian. Its exact site
has not yet been located on the ground but there is strong documentary evidence that
it lay on the Tigris in the vicinity of modern Baghdad (McEwan 1982: 11-12, Wall-
Romana 1990). Some have sought it further upstream (e.g. Westenholz 1999: 31-4)
but an unpublished Old Babylonian letter from Mari records an itinerary that places
Akkade ([a-ka]-de kl ) between the towns of Sippar (modern Abu Habba and Tell ed-
Der) and Tutub (Khafajah) on the route to Eshnunna (Tell Asmar) (Charpin 1988:
150 fn. 68). l The direct route from Sippar to Eshnunna heads north-east to the Tigris
and then up the river Diyala. This suggests a location for Akkade a little downstream
of Baghdad, near the confluence of the two rivers. Since other evidence from Mari
places Akkade at a river-crossing, it seems the strategic importance of Akkade lay in
its control of a vital ferry over the Tigris.

Akkade gave its name to the area around it, mat Akkade "the land of A."; in Sumerian
this country was called ki-Uri "the land of Uri". Uri is a toponym that in Old
Babylonian Akkadian appears as WarVum. Warium was the land east and north of the
confluence of the Tigris and Diyala rivers, later centred on the important city of
Eshnunna. In the 18th-century royal archives of Mari the gentilic adjective akkadum
"Akkadian" refers most often (but not exclusively) to people from the kingdom of



Eshnunna, i.e. the Tigris-Diyala basin (e.g. Durand 1992: 123, Birot 1993: 224).
Similarly a year-name of Samsuiluna of Babylon refers to the troops of Eshnunna as
the "army of Akkade" (year 11, see Charpin 2004: 341). This usage demonstrates a
correct understanding of the historical geography. As already noted, however, when
the ancients used the adjective akkadum with reference to language, they meant the
Semitic language of wider southern Mesopotamia, i.e. Babylonian. The ancient
nomenclature suggests that the people of ancient Iraq considered the area around
Akkade, broadly speaking the north-eastern fringe of Babylonia, to be the historical
heartland of the Babylonian language. As we shall see, this was not exactly the case,
but the notion reflects the special place occupied by the era and legacy of the kings of
Akkade in the intellectual culture of later Babylonia.

In traditional surveys of the history and periodization of Akkadian it has been
conventional to speak of Old Akkadian until the end of the 3rd millennium, and then
a division into Assyrian in the north and Babylonian in the south, each neatly
subdivided into three stages, Old, Middle and New (Neo-Assyrian and Neo-
Babylonian), all six roughly synchronized in pairs, with a prolongation of the
southern dialect as Late Babylonian (Reiner 1966: 20-1, Ungnad 1992: 4-6, von
Soden 1995: 2-5, Buccellati 1996: 1-2, Caplice 1988: 3, Huehnergard 1997: xxiii-
xxv). This picture is over-simplistic (as many of these scholars intimate), especially
in the light of increasing evidence, particularly from the 3rd millennium. A detailed
survey yields a much more complex history.



Akkadian and East Semitic in the mid-3rd millennium

The earliest traces of Akkadian are found predominantly in texts written in Old
Sumerian, the principal written language of southern Iraq in the Early Dynastic
period. Mid-3rd-millennium tablets from such Sumerian towns as Shuruppak (Fara)
and Tell Abu Salabikh attest the existence of individuals bearing names of East
Semitic derivation, in a society where personal names were predominantly Sumerian.
At Abu Salabikh some of the scribes who wrote the famous Early Dynastic literary
tablets bore East Semitic names, demonstrating that such names were part of the
onomastic repertoire drawn on by the educated elites. These names do not, therefore,
necessarily represent the infiltration into southern society of foreign elements from
north Babylonia, but instead speak for a long history of linguistic symbiosis
stretching back several centuries, perhaps well into prehistory. Many loanwords from
East Semitic appear in Old Sumerian and reinforce the impression of what has been
called a Sprachbund, a Sumerian -Akkadian linguistic area (Edzard 2003: 173-8).
Interaction between Sumerian and Akkadian has also been documented in
morphology and syntax; this is evidence of linguistic convergence, implying a
growing similarity over time (Pedersen 1989).

Alongside the evidence for early Akkadian embedded in Sumerian texts are
documents that seem to have been drawn up in an early form (or forms) of Akkadian.







Contemporaneous with the Old Sumerian tablets from Fara and Abu Salabikh, they
are predominantly written in Sumerian logograms but the presence of Semitic
prepositions, pronouns, numbers and other particles betrays the language of
composition. These documents include land deeds, votive inscriptions, a sale contract
and administrative documents, and come predominantly from Kish and elsewhere in
northern Babylonia, but also from as far north as Mari and Terqa on the middle
Euphrates and as far south as Abu Salabikh. On the basis of orthography, language,
system of dating, names of months and persons, this Semitic cultural tradition of the
mid-3rd millennium has been termed the "Kish civilization" (Gelb 1981, 1992).

The votive inscriptions of northern kings of the pre-Sargonic era document the
use of the Semitic language of the Kish civilization in the wielding of political power
at the very beginning of history. An instructive example is the short inscription from
Girsu, in the deep south of Sumer, on a macehead dedicated to Ningirsu by Mesalim,
"king of Kish", who was overlord of much of Sumer about 2600 BC. The inscription
is ostensibly written in Sumerian, but the order of the signs shows that they are
logograms to be read in an East Semitic dialect, presumably an early form of
Akkadian (Wilcke 1993: 35 fn. 32). In this era we must reckon with a situation in
which the south of Babylonia (Sumer) was predominantly Sumerian-speaking, and
the north predominantly Semitic-speaking. Central towns like Nippur and Abu
Salabikh were widely bilingual. Probably this pattern of distribution was already
established in late prehistory. Among the East Semitic languages of 3rd-millennium
and earlier Mesopotamia were ancestral dialects of Akkadian; indeed, much more is
now known of the early history of East Semitic than was the case a few decades ago.

The use of Semitic language in administration, law and displays of royal power
was complemented by literary creativity. Among the many Early Dynastic literary
tablets from Abu Salabikh was a text written not in the conventional Sumerian, as
were the huge majority of extant early literary compositions, but in East Semitic.
Knowledge of this text was much improved by the discoveries at Ebla (Tell Mardikh,
south of Aleppo in Syria). At this site were found copies of late Early Dynastic-
period literature that to some extent replicate the literary corpus attested in Babylonia,
including two important compositions in Semitic, one of them a duplicate of the text
from Abu Salabikh (Lambert 1989, 1992, Krebernik 1992). Between them these early
works of East Semitic literature offer a glimpse of the literary traditions of northern
Babylonia in the pre-Sargonic era, that is, of the literature of the Kish civilization.

By the mid-3rd millennium these literary traditions had spread from north
Babylonia upstream to Mari and thence further into Syria. It appears probable that a
pattern familiar from later eras was already in place: "a written Babylonian-based
Semitic 'high language' with local variations was used and understood throughout
Syro-Mesopotamia, and local spoken Semitic dialects [were] arrayed along a
linguistic continuum stretching from Babylonia across upper Mesopotamia to Ebla,
varying from the written 'high language' to greater or lesser degrees" (Cooper 2000:
69). A Semitic language of south Mesopotamia, whether we know it as East Semitic,







Akkadian or Babylonian, remained the predominant language of writing in Syria for
the best part of a millennium and a half.

The local dialect of Ebla, called Eblaite or Eblaic, is only partly visible to us
because the writing system was predominantly logographic. Most scholars now
consider it to have been an East Semitic language closely related to Akkadian (e.g.
Huehnergard 1995: 2120, Huehnergard and Woods 2004). The language of Ebla has
much in common with what may be called "Mariote", the contemporaneous but little-
known language of pre-Sargonic Mari (Gelb 1992). Some suppose that Eblaite was
imported from Mesopotamia, specifically from Kish and northern Babylonia, where a
"linguistic heterogeneity" is suspected (Michalowski 1987). Others view it as a local,
Syrian variety of Akkadian that speaks for an early distribution of East Semitic
outside Mesopotamia proper (Krebernik 1996),

The later 3rd millennium: Old Akkadian and Ur III Akkadian

Old Akkadian was the term once used to signify all 3rd-millennium Akkadian, and
some choose still to use the phrase thus, despite the increasing evidence for diversity
in the Semitic of pre-Sargonic Mesopotamia. Others use the label to refer only to the
best-known East Semitic of the 3rd-millennium, which can be defined in historical
terms as the official language of the empire established by Sargon of Akkade. The
latter position is taken here: for present purposes Old Akkadian is the Akkadian of the
Sargonic state (otherwise known as Sargonic Akkadian).

Apart from Eblaite, Mariote and the literary East Semitic of the Kish
civilization, little has survived of the linguistic diversity postulated in the preceding
section. Nevertheless, against such a background it would be foolish to assume that as
the 3rd millennium wore on East Semitic was represented in Mesopotamia proper
only by the ancestor of Old Akkadian, The existence of other dialects, contemporary
with Old Akkadian and near relatives of it, can also be postulated on the grounds that,
in linguistic terms, neither the Babylonian nor the Assyrian form of the language is a
direct, lineal descendant of Old Akkadian (Sommerfeld 2003). The two main
varieties of Akkadian evidently had other ancestors.

Old Akkadian. The prominence of Old Akkadian in linguistic history is owed to a
particular circumstance: its use as a written language in the chanceries of Sargon of
Akkade and his successors. Old Akkadian was the official language of record of the
Sargonic state, the vehicle of its monumental inscriptions, administrative texts, and
official correspondence (Text sample 1). It also occurs in private letters and a little
literature. Presumably it was chosen because it was the common tongue of Sargon
and the men of Akkade who governed his dominions. Accordingly it can be defined
in geographical terms as an East Semitic dialect of Uri (Warium) in the Tigris-Diyala
basin, which was the land around Akkade. This marks it as a peripheral dialect
(Sommerfeld 2003). Many other earlier and contemporaneous dialects of East



Babylonian and Assyrian

Ur HI Akkadian, Following the eclipse of the Sargonic kingdom, kings of the
Gutian interregnum emulated Sargonic monumental inscriptions. Power was prised
from the Gutians by a dynasty from Uruk in the Sumerian-speaking south. Choosing
as their capital the nearby city of Ur, they presided over a Sumerian cultural
swansong. In the administration of their state Sumerian took preference over
Akkadian, which was little used in official communication, even if, as many suspect,
it was rapidly ousting Sumerian as the vernacular in the deep south as well as further
north. The Akkadian of this, the Ur III period, used to be considered a continuation of
Old Akkadian. Recent study of what little survives, however, has revised that view,
and the current consensus is that, beneath a mask of 3rd-millennium spelling
conventions, Ur III Akkadian exhibits much greater continuity with what came
afterwards than with what went before. Some describe it as "essentially an archaic
version of Old Babylonian" (Westenholz 1999: 33), even as the ''earliest, precisely
identifiable developmental stage of the Babylonian dialect" (Hilgert 2003: 11). Many
historians now judge the interval between the Sargonic and Ur III periods, the Gutian
interregnum, to have endured for perhaps only a single generation, so that Sargonic
and Ur III Akkadian can be considered nearly contemporaneous. The conclusion has
been drawn that Old Akkadian, originating in northern Babylonia, and Ur III
Akkadian, known mostly from the far south, are geographical variants of Akkadian,
rather than diachronic or sequential forms of the language (Buccellati 2004: 108).
The Akkadian of the Ur III period is now studied by Hilgert 2002.

Archaic north-west Akkadian. From the middle Euphrates region we get a
glimpse of Akkadian as it had developed outside Babylonia. At Mari (Tell Hariri) and
Terqa (Tell al-'Ashara), near Deir ez-Zor, tablets and clay models of livers are extant
from what is known as the period of the military governors (Akk. sakkanakku),
formerly dated after the fall of Ur. These military governors were a succession of
local rulers initially subservient to Akkade but soon independent of first Akkade and
then Ur (Durand 1995). The texts (administrative records and liver omens) exhibit a
form (or forms) of early Akkadian sometimes identified as Old Akkadian (e.g. Edzard
1985). What is meant by this term is not, however, the specific dialect of Warium
used by Sargon and Naram-Sin. The language written at Mari was already
distinctively East Semitic in the Early Dynastic period (see above), and evidently
evolved as an Akkadian dialect. Study of the language of the sakkanakku-psriod at
Mari shows that it still exhibits little evidence of West Semitic influence. This
indicates that Akkadian was more entrenched on the middle Euphrates in the 3rd
millennium than it was in the early 2nd millennium, when Amorite became the
regional vernacular. The dialect of the sakkanakku-pexiod is nevertheless distinct
from the Akkadian of the south and represents a marginal, north-western form of the







language (Westenholz 1978). Archaic north-west Akkadian would be a better term
for this and other early forms of the language from this area.



The early 2nd millennium: archaic Old Babylonian
and Old Assyrian

At the turn of the 3rd millennium the kingdom of Ur collapsed under the onslaught of
Amorite nomads and Elamite invaders. In Babylonia itself, increasing numbers of
written sources enable us to observe the local Akkadian in the period immediately
following the fall of Ur. On the middle Tigris Assyrian emerged as a distinctive local
form of Akkadian.

Archaic Old Babylonian. In the south, the bureaucrats of the successor states of
Ur III continued to use Sumerian as the written language of administration and
government, but in the north Akkadian texts became common again. The principal
evidence comes from Eshnunna in the Diyala basin, where two groups of private
letters document the transition from "archaic Old Babylonian" to classical Old
Babylonian (Whiting 1987). The earlier letters show that here the southern dialect of
Akkadian had ousted the local Old Akkadian by the turn of the millennium. They use
a form of the language barely distinguishable from that written further south in the Ur
III period; in some respects it seems slightly older (Heimpel 2004). The later letters
indicate that this language quickly developed into the classic Old Babylonian dialect,
for they display a form of it found in other corpora of early Old Babylonian texts
(Whiting 1987, 16-19). Very early Old Babylonian royal inscriptions, such as those
of Ashduniarim of Kish, exhibit an archaic subjunctive that may be a mark of an
elevated, literary style.

Old Assyrian. A much larger and more productive body of material is the tablets
from Cappadocia, which hold texts written in an early form of the Assyrian dialect of
Akkadian that we call Old Assyrian. These tablets have been dug up in their
thousands and, as excavations proceed, the number continues to grow at a steady rate.
More than 21,500 are now extant (Michel 2001: 30). They constitute the private
archives of members of Assyrian merchant colonies based mostly at Kanesh, modern
Kultepe, near Kayseri (Text sample 2). Similar tablets have been found in smaller
numbers elsewhere in Anatolia, at Hattusa (Bogazkoy) and Ali§ar, and in and around
Assyria, at Ashur itself and at Gasur, and illustrate the use of Old Assyrian by
businesses across a wide area. Local rulers in Cappadocia could also use Old
Assyrian as a medium of communication. However, documents of an Assyrian
merchant based at Sippar in Babylonia, though dated in Assyrian style, are written in
Old Babylonian (Walker 1980).

of fourteen shekels. Since you went away that Shalim-ahum has set himself up with
two houses. How about us? When shall we ever do that?

Letters and memoranda predominate in the archives of the colony at Kanesh,
but rare copies of royal texts, spells and literary compositions offer a glimpse of other
registers of Old Assyrian. A few Old Assyrian royal inscriptions also survive from
Assyria itself. The Old Assyrian dialect is nearer to Old Akkadian than to Ur III
Akkadian, unsurprisingly given Assyria's northerly location on the middle Tigris, but
a closer kinship has been observed between Assyrian and the pre-Sargonic language
of Ebla and Mari (Parpola 1988). Old Assyrian can be seen as a local development of
one of the East Semitic dialects postulated as spoken in northern Mesopotamia and
Syria in the mid-3rd millennium. Assyrian as a whole differs considerably from
Babylonian in grammar and vocabulary, and maintains many of these distinctions
throughout its history. Orthography, as well as dialect, was distinctive: Old Assyrian
scribes used a restricted syllabary of only about one hundred and thirty signs and
avoided all but a few common logograms. Old Assyrian language and writing have
been well described by Hecker 1968.



The Old Babylonian period

The period when Babylonia, and for a time all Mesopotamia, was dominated by
Babylon under its 1st dynasty is known as the Old Babylonian period (1894-1595 BC
in the conventional chronology), and the Akkadian of the time is called Old
Babylonian.

Old Babylonian. Old Babylonian is considered the classic manifestation of
Akkadian, and is the dialect usually taught to beginners. This is because in its
southern form it shows great regularity, exhibits little contamination by other Semitic
languages, and is the vehicle for a very extensive body of texts. Most famous of these
is the laws of King Hammurapi (18th century), inscribed on a great stone stele found
in 1901 at Susa, where it had been taken as booty in antiquity. Hammurapi' s
monument is widely celebrated as the world's first law code, though it is neither a







code nor the oldest collection of laws. It is certainly the Akkadian text most widely
read in the original language, for beginners in Akkadian customarily grapple with it
in universities worldwide. Old Babylonian is the normative form of Akkadian
described in most standard reference grammars (Ungnad 1992, von Soden 1995,
Buccellati 1996) and teaching manuals (Marcus 1978, Caplice 1988, Huehnergard
1997). It also presents a useful corpus for linguistic research (e.g. Kaplan 2002).

Alongside the many building inscriptions and several edicts of Hammurapi's
dynasty are masses of archival documents (letters, memoranda, legal and
administrative documents) from the same period (Text sample 3). These come
especially from Sippar, Ur and Larsa (Senkereh). Twenty-five years ago they were
thought already to number nearly fifteen thousand texts (Lieberman 1977: 10-11), but
this was probably too conservative an estimate. Extant in far smaller numbers are
monumental texts, both royal and private, e.g. funerary and votive inscriptions, and
other genres of text that use plain Old Babylonian: compendia of omens for use in
divination, astrology etc., with their associated ritual texts; vocabularies and other
pedagogical lists; and other practical texts, such as mathematical problems, medical
therapies, culinary recipes etc.

don't make me upset! Give the land to me and let me work it. I'll do what pleases you
better than any stranger. You just see how well I'll do!

Literary Old Babylonian. Literary forms of Akkadian begin to be better attested in the
Old Babylonian period, though the number of extant tablets and texts remains very
small. The scarcity of Old Babylonian literature, and of narrative poetry in particular,
is explained by the fact that in scribal schools Sumerian remained the language of
instruction to the late 18th century. It was still the old literature in Sumerian that
provided most of the copy-books and was most written down. The Old Babylonian
literary corpus includes magic spells and incantations; omen compendia of all kinds;
hymns, prayers and laments; proverbs, fables and other wisdom literature, love
poetry, and mythological and narrative poetry. Enough survives of the last to show
that the poems of Atram-hasis, Gilgamesh, Anzu and Etana were already present,
alongside compositions about the ancient kings of Akkade. Literary texts in Old
Babylonian display a vibrant poetic language unburdened by the scholasticism that
came later, and give us an inkling of the style and content of what must have been a
very extensive oral literature in Old Babylonian. The most recent studies of literary
Old Babylonian style are Metzler 2002, Wasserman 2003, Izre'el and Cohen 2004.



Babylonian and Assyrian

Some Old Babylonian literary texts use an elevated register of the poetic
language that is often known as "hymno-epic dialect" (Text sample 4). This is not a
true dialect but literary Old Babylonian embellished with archaizing features,
especially of morphology and vocabulary (von Soden 1931-3, Groneberg 1971, 1978-
9). Some of these features are observed in older forms of Akkadian, not only Old
Akkadian but also the archaic Old Babylonian of the earlier group of letters from
Eshnunna (Whiting 1987: 18).

Syrup-sweet her lips, her mouth is life itself,

Old Babylonian literary texts in Akkadian come not only from Babylonia but
also, in smaller quantities, from peripheral areas. The Sumero-Babylonian scribal
tradition is well attested at Susa in Elam, so the presence there of a few Akkadian
literary texts is unsurprising. More revealing is group of late Old Babylonian omen
tablets, whose spellings attest to a peripheral orthographic tradition (Labat 1974).
Some of these texts' curious spelling conventions also occur in the roughly
contemporaneous omen tablets from Tigunanum on the upper Tigris below
Diyarbakir, which were certainly not composed in Babylonia. Fragments of late Old
Babylonian omen texts recovered at Hazor in modern Israel show just how far abroad
this typically Akkadian genre travelled. Another text composed in the periphery was
a Babylonian heroic poem to the glory of king Zimri-Lim of Mari. The discovery of
Old Babylonian cuneiform outside Babylonia sheds light on the diffusion of
Babylonian intellectual culture to peripheral areas, on its reception and adaptation
there, and on Babylonian Akkadian as a vehicle of original literary expression outside
Babylonia. It also reveals the varieties of Akkadian used in peripheral areas at this
time.



Provincial and barbarized Old Babylonian. Visible in the extant records for a
timespan of three centuries, Old Babylonian is not monolithic: differences in
phonology, grammar, syntax and spelling do arise from era to era, place to place and







register to register (viz. literary vs. vernacular), but they are comparatively small and
the dialect can be said to be a coherent, though evolving, whole. For the most part
local and diachronic variants of vernacular Old Babylonian remain to be studied in
detail; a good example of one such local variant is the provincial Akkadian written in
this period in Elam, where a significant Akkadian-speaking population may have
been descendants of immigrants from southern Babylonia (Lambert 1991). The
Akkadian of Old Babylonian Elam has been studied by De Meyer 1962 and Salonen
1962.

A special place, however, is occupied by the Old Babylonian dialects of the
middle Euphrates and beyond. The extensive royal archives of Mari, excavated in the
1930s and since, number about twenty thousand pieces, and have been supplemented
by smaller finds at Tell al-Rimah and other sites in upper Mesopotamia. These texts
exhibit a form of provincial Old Babylonian also current in the Diyala region but
more affected by the local West Semitic vernacular, Amorite, especially in
vocabulary. Possibly it was never spoken, but used only as a written language in
chancery. It has been described by Finet 1956 and Charpin 1989. A variety of Old
Babylonian similar to that current in Mari was also written in the southern Levant, as
demonstrated by tablets from Hazor, Shechem and Hebron in Palestine (Rainey 1999:
154*-5*). A purer form of Old Babylonian was used for royal building inscriptions
by kings of Mari, notably Yahdun-Lim, and by other upper Mesopotamian kings of
this period, especially Shamshi-Adad I.

More barbarized forms of Akkadian undoubtedly existed on the periphery. At
Shusharra (Tell Shemshara), in the upland valley of the Lesser Zab in Iraqi Kurdistan,
was found a modest archive of letters and administrative texts left by a local ruler
who was a correspondent of Shamshi-Adad I. The letters from Shamshi-Adad exhibit
a dialect close to that written at Mari. Those of more local origin display another
provincial dialect of Old Babylonian (Kupper 2001). Personal names indicate the
predominance here of Hurrian, a regional vernacular increasingly found across a large
area of upper Mesopotamia, north Syria and Kurdistan. An early glimpse of
Humanized Akkadian can be seen in the older group of texts excavated by Woolley
at Alalah (Tell Acana) in the Turkish Hatay. The chancery of Yarim-Lim of Alalah
(17th century) could write excellent formal Old Babylonian, but the imprint of
Hurrian is increasingly observed in archival documents (Aro 1954-6, Giacumakis
1970).

In its variety the Babylonian written in the western and eastern peripheries
early in the 2nd millennium conforms to the pattern already noted for the mid-3rd
millennium. Provincial chanceries imported the technology of cuneiform writing
from Babylonia, and with it texts of the scribal tradition written in good Babylonian.
These provided a linguistic model for official inscriptions and international
correspondence. Less permanent documents exhibited a greater influence of
vernacular forms, whether West Semitic (Amorite) or Hurrian. The language of
writing, whatever the register, was not a local vernacular. Later in the 2nd millennium
the Akkadian of the western periphery is exposed in still greater variety.







The later 2nd millennium: Middle Babylonian, Middle Assyrian

and international Akkadian

The end of Hammurapi's dynasty came when Babylon fell to a raid by the Hittite
adventurer Mursili I, a date conventionally fixed at 1595 BC This was a cataclysmic
event: the city was abandoned and probably remained so for many years. In the
current scheme of linguistic history the fall of Babylon marks the end of the Old
Babylonian dialect. The political vacuum was filled by a dynasty of kings of Kassite
origin and by the little-known rulers of the Sealand, already established as a power in
the far south. After an interval of uncertain length the Kassite dynasty imposed their
dominion over all Babylonia and remained in power until the twelfth century. The
throne then fell into the hands of a sequence of rulers known as the 2nd dynasty of
Isin (1157-1026 BC). The language of Babylonia under these three dynasties,
especially the Kassite era, is called Middle Babylonian.

Middle Babylonian. The development of Old into Middle Babylonian was a slow
evolution, at least in southern Mesopotamia. The application of a different term for
Babylonian as it appeared in the latter part of the 2nd millennium arose not because
Middle Babylonian is radically different from late Old Babylonian but because a long
gap intrudes between the fall of Babylon and the reappearance in the south of
documentation on a large scale. This interval is often characterized as a Dark Age.
The darkness is gradually dispersing, however, for several large caches of tablets of
the period immediately following the fall of Babylon have recently come to light and
await publication. As the gap in documentation fills, so more will be known of the
development of Akkadian in the mid-2nd millennium. It is already apparent that
many of those traits thought characteristic of Middle Babylonian appear sporadically
in later Old Babylonian (Lieberman 1977: 8-9 fn. 21). Legal texts from Tell
Muhammad in the Diyala basin that post-date the fall and resettlement of Babylon are
reported to continue Old Babylonian traditions. Clearly the transition was gradual.

The corpus of texts in Middle Babylonian has been estimated at fifteen
thousand documents but the vast majority still awaits publication (Brinkman 1976:
3). Finds from 14th and 13th-century Nippur predominate, numbering about twelve
thousand. These are mostly letters and legal and administrative documents, some of
them connected with the personnel of the temple of Enlil at Nippur and with the
management of its estates and income. Smaller groups of Middle Babylonian archival
documents come from Ur, Dur-Kurigalzu and Babylon and date mostly to the 13th
and 12th centuries. Other well-known Babylonian cities have yielded isolated finds;
from provincial Tell Imlihiye on the Diyala comes the small 13th-century archive of a
farming family (Kessler 1982). Letters of diplomacy sent by two 14th-century Kassite
kings, Kadashman-Enlil I and Burnaburiash II, turned up in the Egyptian royal







archives found at El-Amarna in the 1880s and '90s. Letters of other Kassite kings
survive in later copies. Royal building and votive inscriptions in Akkadian are
comparatively rare, for an artificial form of Sumerian was favoured here, but a typical
product of the royal chancery of this period are land grants written in Middle
Babylonian and inscribed on beautiful stone monuments called kudurrus. Middle
Babylonian has been described by Aro 1955.

The late 2nd millennium is known as a time of considerable literary creativity
and also of scholarly editorial work that brought old compositions up to date and
standardized them. Very little literature of the period has survived on Middle
Babylonian tablets, however, and it is best known from lst-millennium copies.
Pedagogical texts and other tablets from scribal schooling preserve scraps of the
standard Kassite-period copy-books, enough to show that the old Sumerian texts had
largely been abandoned and their place taken by works in Akkadian, some of them
new compositions, others already known in the Old Babylonian period. These, again,
are mostly from Nippur, with a smattering from Ur and Babylon. Narrative poetry is
represented by Gilgamesh and Atram-hasis, professional literature by an increasing
number of omen compendia and medical tablets. The vehicle for some of this corpus
is Middle Babylonian similar to the contemporaneous letters, but the poetic
compositions, especially, were written (or rewritten) in a literary register of the
language that English-speaking scholars call Standard Babylonian {Jungbabylonisch
in German). The chief evidence for Standard Babylonian is lst-millennium copies of
literary texts and the royal inscriptions composed for the Sargonid kings of Assyria,
and it will be discussed below, in the section on the early 1st millennium.



Middle Assyrian. Akkadian continued to be spoken and written in Assyria, where
it is known in the late 2nd millennium as Middle Assyrian. Here there is a much
longer hiatus between the Old and Middle forms of the local dialect. Middle Assyrian
documents come principally from Ashur, excavated before the 1st world war. The
many archives of letters, legal and administrative documents found there stem from
the 14th to 11th centuries, with a predominant number dating to the 13th. Other such
texts come from Shibaniba (Tell Billa) near Nineveh, Tell al-Rimah and other sites in
the Jezirah, where they document the presence of Assyrian officials posted locally.

From about the time of Adad-narari I (1307-1275) the royal inscriptions of
Assyrian kings are mostly written in slightly Assyrianizing Middle Babylonian,
demonstrating the continuing prestige of the Babylonian dialect in Assyria first
observed when the region was ruled by Shamshi-Adad I. Middle Babylonian copies
of southern literary compositions were imported to Assyria, especially as booty by
Tukulti-Ninurta I when he sacked Babylon (about 1230 BC). From this time on
Assyria, so often mightier than Babylonia in war and political influence, was under
the cultural domination of its southern neighbour. More or less the entire Babylonian
scribal tradition seems to have been known in 11th-century Assyria. Narrative poetry
such as the poem of Etana, Ishtar's Descent and the Sumerian Lugale and



Babylonian and Assyrian



50







Angimdimma (by this time in bilingual SumeroBaby Ionian format), other literary
compositions and scholarly texts - hymns, omens, incantations, rituals, medical texts,
hemerologies, Hammurapi's laws, lexical lists - were handed down in Assyrian
copies that survive today. Over generations some of this Babylonian literature
became more or less Assyrianized. New literature in praise of Assyrian might was
composed locally, also in Babylonian; this includes the Tukulti-Ninurta epic.

The great Middle Assyrian law code, the unique palace edicts that regulate
conduct at the Assyrian court, the Assyrian coronation ritual, however, all these had
no literary pretensions and were written in pure Middle Assyrian, as was one of King
Ashur-uballit' s two letters to pharaoh, found at El-Amarna. Middle Assyrian has been
studied by Mayer 1971.

If a man says to his friend, whether in private or in a fight, "Your wife sleeps

man shall be flogged forty strokes of the rod, shall do the king's labour for a full
month, have his head shaved and pay a fine of one talent of tin {or lead).



Peripheral Akkadian. Akkadian continued to be employed beyond the bounds of
Babylonia and Assyria proper. In the latter part of the 2nd millennium there is
extensive evidence for peripheral dialects of Akkadian and for the continuing spread
of literary Babylonian outside Mesopotamia. Legal documents from Terqa on the
middle Euphrates and private archives from Ekalte (Tell Munbaqa) further upstream
exhibit a continuation of Old Babylonian traditions of writing. However, by the early
Kassite period (16th century) the Babylonian written at Terqa contained provincial
traits, including loans from West Semitic and the occasional Assyrianism (Podany
1991-3). Middle Assyrian eventually prevailed here as the language of writing.

Archives excavated at Gasur, at this time known as Nuzi, in the 1920s and '30s
yielded about seven thousand tablets distributed among perhaps as many as forty
archives, institutional and private. Similar tablets also came from nearby Arrapha
(Kirkuk) and Tell al-Fakhar. They hold legal and juridical documents, letters and
administrative texts written in a form of Akkadian much influenced by the local
Hurrian vernacular and dating to the 15th and 14th centuries. This is the period just
before the rise of the Middle Assyrian state under Ashur-uballit I, who was probably
responsible for Nuzi's destruction. The local suzerain was the king of Arrapha, a
vassal in turn of Mittanni, at that time a greater power than Assyria. The use of
Akkadian by kings of Mittanni is well documented (Adler 1976) and speaks for the
continuing dominance of Babylonian as a written means of communication in upper
Mesopotamia, outside Assyria proper. Unsurprisingly, therefore, the Humanized
Akkadian of Nuzi is more akin to early Middle Babylonian than to Assyrian, though
it shows occasional Assyrianisms. The language of the Nuzi texts has been studied by
Berkooz 1937 and Wilhelm 1970.

Our knowledge of the Akkadian written in Levantine Syria in the same period
formerly rested on 15th-century tablets from Alalah, treaties involving the local
rulers, Idrimi and his son Niqmepa, and Idrimf s autobiographical statue inscription.
The Humanized Akkadian of these texts is described by Rowe 1998. Also extant, but
less informative linguistically, was an archive of inventories unearthed by a pre-war







French expedition at Qatna (Tell Mishrife), further up the Orontes valley in Syria.
The evidence has been much augmented by the discovery of an important 14th-
century royal archive during the new excavations at Qatna. This archive of letters and
administrative documents will shed fascinating new light on the political relations of
this small Syrian city-state with the major powers, at a time when Mittanni was
retreating before the expansion of the Hittite empire. As regards the study of
language, the epigraphists deciphering the archive report the use of a new variety of
Humanized Akkadian (Richter 2002). Extensive glossing in Hurrian shows very
clearly that Hurrian was the local vernacular.

Further south, at Taanach (Tell Ti'innik) near Megiddo in Palestine, 15th-
century letters and administrative documents are early evidence for a form of local
Babylonian under West Semitic influence (Rainey 1999). In Elam, east of Babylonia,
scribes were briefly writing Akkadian again, as shown by 14th-century archives from
Kabnak (Haft Tepe), near Susa (Glassner 1991). The texts are mostly administrative
but an omen list is evidence for the Babylonian scribal tradition and curious
orthographies again speak for a local tradition of cuneiform scholarship (Herrero and
Glassner 1996). The local vernacular of Elam at this time was Middle Elamite, but
the prestige of Babylonian is also seen in its use in several monumental inscriptions
of King Untash-napirisha (13th century). This ruler was evidently what might be
called a Babylonophile, for he gave his new ceremonial cult-centre an Akkadian
name, Al-Untash "Untash-town" (now Choga Zambil). A century later, however,
Shutruk-Nahhunte and his sons Kutir-Nahhunte and Shilhak-Inshushinak, the
vanquishers of Babylon (sacked in 1 157 BC), had their inscriptions written in Elamite
alone.

By the floruit of the Nuzi and Qatna archives scribes were writing Akkadian in
Anatolia again. As elsewhere in the West the Babylonian scribal tradition had been
imported wholesale to the Hittite capital at Hattusa along with the technology of
cuneiform writing. This was most probably not a single event but a continuing
process. One reason for suspecting this is that texts of the scribal tradition can be seen
there at several stages in their development. For example, the Babylonian Epic of
Gilgamesh occurs first in an early 14th-century copy very close to an Old Babylonian
version known from Babylonia, then as a partly garbled Akkadian paraphrase (13th-
century copy), probably composed locally or in north Syria, and also as a story retold
in Hittite and in Hurrian.

International Akkadian. Already employed at Hattusa during the Hittite Old
Kingdom, when royal texts of Hattusili I were furnished with Akkadian translations
(Gaiter 1995: 36-7), Akkadian is most visible there as an international language for
diplomatic correspondence and treaty-writing in the service of the Hittite state
(described by Labat 1932, Durham 1976, Marazzi 1986). In this the Hittites were
falling into line with the rest of the East Mediterranean. What might be called
"international" Akkadian is best known from the Egyptian royal archives of El-
Amarna (ancient Akhetaten), the short-lived capital of the 14th-century pharaoh







Akhenaten (Amenophis IV), from smaller archives of the same period, such as that at
Kumidi (Kamid el-Loz) in Lebanon, and from isolated finds such as those of Sidon,
on the Lebanese coast, and of Hazor, Tell Aphek, Gezer and Beth Shean in modern
Israel. These demonstrate that during the Late Bronze Age a very extensive network
of diplomatic links was in place between the major and minor powers of the Near
East and their vassals, and Akkadian was the medium of international
communication. The Hittite monarch and the kings of Babylonia and Assyria, the
ruler of Alashiya (Cyprus), Egyptian vassals like Abdi-Ashirta of Amurru, Rib-Hadda
of Byblos and Abi-Milku of Tyre: all wrote to pharaoh in forms of Akkadian and
received his reply in Akkadian.

Royal letters from kings of the Kassite dynasty of Babylon have already been
mentioned in discussing Middle Babylonian, and the Middle Assyrian letter of an
Assyrian ruler has also been noted. The language of most of the Amarna
correspondence, however, was far from these pure Mesopotamian dialects, exhibiting
many provincial archaisms and very considerable influence of local tongues. It was
not homogeneous. Letters from Hittite, north Syrian and Egyptian chanceries indicate
greater or lesser influence of Hurrian, and are held to represent a northern, Hurro-
Akkadian tradition of writing and language. In the southern Levant various forms of
pidgin- Akkadian were used, more or less combining Babylonian vocabulary with
local West Semitic (Canaanite) grammar (Moran 1992: xviii-xxii, Rainey 1996,
Izre'el 1998). Akkadian dialects of the Amarna period have lately been given
renewed attention (Sivan 1984, Gianto 1990, Izre'el 1991, Moran 2003, Cochavi-
Rainey 2003).

Like the cuneiform scribes of Hattusa, the writers of the letters of the Amarna
archives learnt to master cuneiform in the traditional way, so that texts of the
Babylonian scribal tradition have been recovered from El- Amarna. These are mostly
lexical texts but include also poems on mythological and heroic subjects, such as
Adapa, Nergal and Ereshkigal, and Sargon King of Battle. The Egyptians were taught
cuneiform writing by Hittites of the Old Kingdom (16th- 15th centuries), and some
Akkadian literature found at Amarna bears a Hurro-Hittite cultural imprint. This
means that though in Egypt cuneiform writing has so far only turned up at 14th-
century Amarna, older finds are to be expected. Other compositions, handed down at
Amarna in good Middle Babylonian recensions, imply continuing influence, either
directly from Mesopotamia or through Syro-Mesopotamian intermediaries. There was
certainly a tradition of cuneiform learning in the southern Levant well before the
tablets from Amarna. The presence of Old Babylonian at Hazor has already been
mentioned, as has the early Middle Babylonian archive from Taanach. Megiddo can
also be cited, where a Middle Babylonian paraphrase of Gilgamesh was already
known in perhaps the 15th century. So in writing Akkadian, Akhenaten 's chancery at
Amarna was following the trend, not leading it. While we talk of the Amarna period
as exemplifying the widespread use of international Akkadian in the eastern
Mediterranean region of the 14th century, it should be remembered that this was not
an innovation of this period, even in Egypt.







Later evidence reveals the full extent of cuneiform learning and Akkadian
writing in the West. Towards the end of the 2nd millennium much of the Near East,
particularly around the eastern Mediterranean, suffered in the catastrophes that
brought the Late Bronze Age to an end. Among cities that fell at that time were
Alalah, Ugarit (Ras Shamra) on the Mediterranean seaboard, and Emar (Meskene) on
the Euphrates downstream of Carchemish. Destruction levels at Ugarit and Emar,
especially, have yielded many archives of cuneiform tablets, large and small, ranging
across the 14th to 12th centuries. Their texts demonstrate again the use in the
periphery of local forms of written Akkadian for practical communication and
documentation - the familiar combination of letters, legal, juridical and administrative
texts - built on an education in the scribal tradition imported from Babylonia. The
latter is represented by lexical texts, scholarly compendia, fables and wisdom
literature, Middle Babylonian Gilgamesh and an account of the flood, no doubt a
fragment of the poem of Atram-hasis. The Akkadian of Ugarit has been much
researched (Swaim 1962, Huehnergard 1989, van Soldt 1991), and linguistic studies
of Emar Akkadian are fast catching up (Ikeda 1995, 1998, Seminara 1998, Pentiuc
2001).

The end of the Late Bronze Age in the eastern Mediterranean brought with it a
breakdown in international communications that spelled the termination of local
traditions of Akkadian writing in Mediterranean Syria, Egypt and Anatolia, and, after
perhaps 1500 years, the end in the west of the cultural domination of Babylonian
language and scribal traditions.



The early 1st millennium: Neo-Assyrian,
Standard and Neo-Baby Ionian

The transition to the Iron Age coincides with a loss of documentation that intervenes
in the history of Akkadian. The turn of the millennium marks the beginning of a
period of confusion in Mesopotamia, as a flowing tide of Arameans overran the
north, for all the earlier efforts of Tiglath-pileser I (1114-1076) to stem it, leading to
the eventual collapse of Assyrian power. Recovery lay two centuries away.
Babylonia, already weakened by Assyrian invasion, succumbed first to famine and
then to more Arameans.

Until recently this interval of silence was a convenient point to divide Middle
Babylonian and Middle Assyrian from the later dialects, but new discoveries sharpen
the picture. A ninth-century diplomatic letter, sent to the king of Hama in Syria from
Anat (now Ana) on the middle Euphrates, gives a rare glimpse of the southern
language late in the evolution of Middle to Neo-Baby Ionian (Parpola 1990). The
transition from Middle to Neo-Assyrian was explored by Postgate 1997. Evidence
from provincial centres adds to the picture, demonstrating that the evolution of
Middle to Neo-Assyrian had already begun in the early 11th century. Inscriptions of
Ashur-ketti-leshir, a king of Mari and vassal of Tiglath-pileser I, are couched in







heavily Assyrianized Babylonian, and some of their Assyrianisms anticipate Neo-
Assyrian grammar and spelling (Maul 1992: 18-19). A small archive of legal
documents excavated in south-eastern Turkey at Giricano, on the upper Tigris
(ancient Dunnu-sha-Uzibi), dates to the same era, and exhibits what is clearly a
transitional dialect, already partly Neo-Assyrian (Radner 2004: 53-4).

The darkness lifts gradually: as the nation states of Mesopotamia reasserted
their authority, economic stability increased and written sources grow in number.
Assyria was the first to recover its political and military might, especially under kings
Ashurnasirpal II (883-859) and Shalmaneser III (858-824), who campaigned
vigorously and successfully pushed back the frontiers of the Assyrian state on all
sides. In this era of renewed Assyrian strength it is significant that the long
inscriptions that report these kings' campaigns are written in a form of Babylonian
under heavy Assyrian influence (Deller 1957a, b). Further west and north, the local
ascendancy of Assyrian over Babylonian is clearer still. A statue of Hadad-yis'i, an
Aramean who became Assyrian provincial governor of Bit-Bahiyani in the mid-9th
century, was found at Tell Fekheriye in the Habur triangle, inscribed with text in both
Akkadian and Aramaic. The Akkadian is partly Assyrian and partly an Assyrianized
literary Babylonian (Fales 1983). In Urartu, a short-lived but troublesome kingdom
based near Lake Van, royal inscriptions of the late 9th century were couched in
Assyrian, though this experiment soon gave way to Assyrian-Urartian bilingualism
and monolingual Urartian texts (Wilhelm 1986, Gaiter 1995: 37-9).

Neo-Assyrian. In Assyria itself archival documents appear again in the 9th century
(at Shibaniba) and become more common in the late 8th century, turning into a flood
by the reigns of Sargon II (721-705), Esarhaddon (680-669) and Ashurbanipal (668-
627). Private and public documents occur, but texts from the great institutions of state
predominate, especially archives from the successive royal capitals of Kalah
(Nimrud) and Nineveh (Kuyunjik). Among the twenty thousand tablets and fragments
excavated at Nineveh in the 1850s and subsequently, it is estimated that archival
documents - letters, legal and administrative documents, royal grants and decrees,
officials' reports, especially from diviners, astrologers and other scholars, and
oracular questions on matters of state - add up to more than 5,500 (Parpola 1986:
228). These derive overwhelmingly from the period 721 to 645 and document the
history and politics of imperial Assyria in extraordinary detail (Text sample 6).

Smaller quantities of tablets come from other Assyrian cities, especially Ashur,
and from provincial centres across the Jazira (Guzana-Tell Halaf, Til-Barsip, Dur-
Katlimmu etc.). Isolated discoveries from more distant provinces of the empire are
the Neo-Assyrian tablets found at Tarsus in Cilicia (Goetze 1939), at Samaria, the
capital of Israel taken by Shalmaneser V in 722 BC (Pedersen 1998: 225), and further
south at Gezer (Macalister 1911: 22-30). These document the activities of expatriate
bureaucrats and are legacies of imperial administration and practice. They do not
speak for any re-establishment in the west of cuneiform and Akkadian as media of
local communication and intellectual activity.







The language of all these documents is Neo-Assyrian. In Neo-Assyrian the
influence of Aramaic on Akkadian is seen for the first time. In the written form of the
language Aramaisms are very limited but Aramaic notes written on many tablets
indicate the growing currency of Aramaic as the vernacular language. In a multi-
ethnic empire where natives of Assyria were hugely outnumbered by Aramaic-
speakers from upper Mesopotamia and Levantine Syria, many of them forcibly
resettled in the heartland of Assyria itself, the native dialect was fast losing ground as
a spoken language. It continued to be written, however, where tradition dictated that
it was the proper medium of communication. This was so even after the collapse of
the empire, for legal texts from Dur-Katlimmu (Tell Sheikh Hamad) on the river
Habur, dated to the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon, document the survival of
written Assyrian a little after the fall of Nineveh and the demise of the imperial
Assyrian government (Radner 2002). The Neo-Assyrian scribal tradition lived on at
Harran, one of the old imperial cities, to influence the monumental inscriptions of
Nabonidus (555-539) (Schaudig 2001: 72-3). Neo-Assyrian letters were early the
subject of special grammatical study (Ylvisaker 1912) and the dialect has met with
renewed attention more recently (Hameen-Anttila 2000, Luukko 2004).

the king's duty and come back?'" I am sending him right now to the king my lord.

Alongside the masses of archival documents in the Neo-Assyrian dialect, the
early 1st millennium also bears witness to a brief flowering of Assyrian court
literature and religious poetry. The long tradition of native scholarship in Sumero-
Babylonian textual analysis began also to spawn academic works in the Neo-Assyrian
dialect. Though short-lived, these are further signs of the growing prestige of
Assyrian in intellectual culture during the hegemony of the Assyrian empire.



Standard Babylonian. Notwithstanding the Assyrians' literary creativity in their
own dialect, Babylonian maintained its position as the foremost language of literary
expression. The Sargonid kings, especially, opted to produce royal building
inscriptions and annals in the literary register of Babylonian, introduced above as
Standard Babylonian. This is the dialect of Akkadian in which was phrased much of
the literature handed down in the scribal tradition of the 1 st millennium, ranging from
mythological and other narrative poetry, through hymns and poetic prayers, fables
and wisdom literature, pseudo-autobiography and didactic poetry, and the occasional
folktale, to scholarly compendia (e.g. omens), professional literature (e.g. exorcistic
and therapeutic texts), calendar lore and technical treatises. Some of this literature
was very old, being traceable back to Old Babylonian recensions. Examples are
narrative poems in comparatively plain style: Anzu, Atram-hasis, Etana, Ishtar's
Descent to the Netherworld and Gilgamesh (Text sample 7). Other compositions
derived from later in the 2nd millennium, often displaying the more recherche
vocabulary and learned touches of Middle Babylonian scholar poets. The Creation
epic (Enuma elis) comes under this category, as does the poem of the Righteous
Sufferer (Ludlul bel nemeqi).





For his friend Enkidu Gilgamesh

was weeping bitterly as he roamed the wild:
"I shall die, and shall I not then be like Enkidu?

Sorrow has entered my heart.
I became afraid of death, so go roaming the wild,

to Uta-napishti, son of Ubar-Tutu,

I am on the road and travelling swiftly."

Almost all of Standard Babylonian literature is currently known only from lst-
millennium copies. These derive from Assyrian royal, temple and private libraries of
the 8th to 7th centuries and from Babylonian private and temple libraries of later
centuries. Isolated finds at Hama in Syria (Laess0e 1956) and Tarsus in Cilicia
(Goetze 1939: No. 8) demonstrate that agents of the Assyrian empire had such tablets
in the west, but these were surely exports and not evidence of any local engagement
with Babylonian culture. The practice of copying texts from the Sumero-Baby Ionian
scribal tradition was in this period restricted to Mesopotamia proper, and from the 6th
century confined to Babylonia alone. By this era, and probably for some time before,
the Standard Babylonian corpus was no longer living literature, but the preserve
chiefly of the scholars and students engaged in teaching and learning cuneiform and
in writing ceremonial texts in traditional literary language. At the Assyrian and
Babylonian courts and in the market place the more vital language of literary
expression and oral literary tradition was undoubtedly Aramaic.

Nevertheless, Standard Babylonian remained a productive dialect throughout
the 1st millennium, alongside new developments in style that were less successful
(Lambert 1968). Most inscriptions of Nabopolassar and his successors display
Standard Babylonian language and word order, even if they are often falsely
characterized as Neo- or Late Babylonian. The prose of Nabonidus (555-539) exults
in a particularly high literary Standard Babylonian that occasionally reads almost as
poetry. Among later rulers, Cyrus of Persia (538-530) and the Seleucid Antiochus I
Soter (281-261) both put out commemorative inscriptions in the traditional style.







Standard Babylonian is not a homogeneous dialect. The modes of expression
range from self-consciously ornate and highly archaizing, reminiscent of the "hymno-
epic" style of some Old Babylonian poetry, to much plainer modes of expression that
are nevertheless old. For example, a stylistic device favoured especially by the
composers of the Sargonid annals was the placing of the verb in penultimate position
in its clause, a feature of prose style met above in Old Akkadian monumental texts.
The grammar of all forms of Standard Babylonian, allowing for variations in spelling
and the occasional intrusion of vernacular, exhibits a recognizable affinity with Old
Babylonian. Perhaps its greatest unifying feature is that this was always elevated, old-
fashioned language, distinct from any kind of vernacular Akkadian in lexicon,
phrasing and word order. The standard treatment is Reiner 1966. Studies of different
kinds of Standard Babylonian have concentrated on the epic poetry (Hecker 1974),
"hymnic" literature (Groneberg 1987) and royal inscriptions (Stein 2000, Schaudig
2001).

Neo-Babylonian. The vernacular form of the southern dialect, Neo-Babylonian,
was also used at the imperial Assyrian court, for after the final annexation of
Babylonia under Sennacherib in 689 BC, many Babylonian officials, scholars and
administrators employed it in their dealings with the government and received letters
back in the same dialect (Text sample 8). The language of the Neo-Babylonian letters
from Nineveh has been explored in Woodington 1982 and de Vaan 1995.

Regarding the message you wrote . . . , "If it is acceptable to the king I will write a
letter to the king in Aramaic style," why can you not write a letter to me in Akkadian
style? Be sure that the document you write is like this one [i.e. in cuneiform]. It is the
custom. Let it remain so!

In the south, a glimpse of early Neo-Babylonian is given by the governor's
archive from 8th-century Nippur, which contains a mix of letters with texts from the
Sumero-Babylonian scribal tradition. Neo-Babylonian archival documents begin to
become common in the late 7th century. As Babylon gained economic power as the
seat of a new empire, and other southern cities such as Sippar, Cutha, Borsippa,
Dilbat, Nippur, Ur and Uruk prospered with it, the extant documentation increases.
Twenty years ago it was estimated that more than thirteen thousand archival
documents - letters, economic, business, juridical and legal documents - dating to the
Neo-Babylonian and Persian periods had already been published (Dandamayev 1986:







274). This is only a small fraction of the extant whole, however: the administrative
archive of the temple of Shamash at Sippar excavated by Rassam between 1878 and
1882 numbers at least twice that quantity of pieces on its own. At perhaps ten
thousand tablets even the archive of Eanna at Uruk (7th to 5th centuries) looks small
by comparison. Alongside huge institutional archives of this kind are extensive
dossiers that document over several generations the activities of families of
businessmen, such as the Murashu family at Nippur and the Egibi family at Babylon.
Here attempts to understand the form and function of the archives have taken
precedence over grammatical research. The language of the business documents was
studied by Tallqvist 1890. More recently scholars have concentrated on individual
aspects of the dialect (e.g. Dietrich 1969, Streck 1995).

The empire of Nabopolassar (625-605) and his successors took many
Babylonians abroad, in the service of the imperial administration and on private
ventures. Tablets from expatriates' archives have surfaced in several Levantine cities
but, as in the Neo-Assyrian period, they speak only of the use there of Akkadian
cuneiform by people of Mesopotamian origin, not of any local revival of cuneiform
writing (Dalley 1993: 141-3). One Babylonian family left an archive of Neo-
Babylonian legal documents at Nereb (Neirab), near Aleppo, where they lived in the
mid-6th century. Some of their tablets were glossed with Aramaic notations. This
practice became more common in Babylonia itself in the 5th century, when it speaks
for a growing reliance on Aramaic among the record-keeping classes. As in Assyria,
Aramaic was strongly entrenched in the Babylonian south early in the imperial
period, boosted by a large population of Aramean and Chaldean descent. The
prevalence of Aramaic surely had a greater effect on spoken Babylonian than on the
written language, which remained remarkably impervious to Aramaic loanwords. The
loss of inflected endings on nouns was probably a development speeded up by
analogy with Aramaic. The writing of cuneiform was also affected by the advent of
bilingual literacy. Changes in spelling conventions can be attributed to the influence
of Aramaic writing practices.

It was not all one-way traffic: Babylonian had some influence on Aramaic too
(Kaufman 1974), but the suspicion is that it was steadily losing ground as a
vernacular, spoken language when Nebuchadnezzar II (604-562) made Babylon great
again. The strength of the cuneiform tradition kept it alive as a written language for
centuries more.







The end of Akkadian: Late Babylonian
and cuneiform scholarship

Babylon fell to Cyrus the Great of Persia in 539 BC. This date marks the end in
ancient history of independent nation states in Mesopotamia, but Babylonian
civilization was far from spent. Religious life and intellectual culture continued much
as before, perpetuating by many centuries the ancient languages that were their
vehicles (Oelsner 2002b). Under the Achaemenid Persians, Akkadian found use as
one of several languages of state display, most famously in the trilingual rock
inscription of Darius I (521-486) at Bisutun (Behistun) in Iran. Only a single Neo-
Babylonian tablet was found among the large archive excavated in the fortification
wall at Darius' capital, Persepolis, for this king's use of Akkadian was ceremonial not
practical. Imperial Aramaic was the official lingua franca of the Persian empire.
From the time of Xerxes I (485-465) there is across Babylonia generally a marked
decrease in the number of Neo-Baby Ionian archival documents now extant. It seems
that increasingly more communication and record-keeping were being done in
Aramaic alone. The great temple of Shamash at Sippar abandoned cuneiform writing
early in Xerxes' reign, presumably in favour of the alternative technology. Private
letters become very rare after about 450 BC, a development that signals for most
scholars the final extinction of a vernacular Babylonian tongue, after a long decline.

The death of the Akkadian language was much prolonged, however, for it was
bound up with the death of cuneiform writing. The persistence of the ancient script
kept Akkadian alive among the scribal classes long after it ceased to be anybody's
first language. From the extant documentation the general trend of the later 1st
millennium is clear: as in private life Aramaic writing was adopted more widely, and
as in public life successive non-native governments demanded expertise first in
Aramaic and then in Greek, so cuneiform was used for an ever more restricted set of
purposes. This in turn steadily diminished the number of those who had occasion to
learn and use the Akkadian language.



Late Babylonian. The convention is to divide the vernacular Babylonian of the 1st
millennium into Neo-Baby Ionian and Late Babylonian. There is no consensus as to
where in time the division should occur. Some place it at the accession of
Nabopolassar, others at the capture of Babylon by Cyrus eighty-six years later. Both
are manifestly dates of political rather than linguistic significance and neither marks a
clear discontinuity in the history of the southern dialect. However, the Babylonian
written under Alexander the Great, his successors the Seleucid kings, and then the
Parthian dynasty of Iran, shows a definite evolution from 7th-century language, and
rightly deserves the label Late Babylonian.

At Babylon and Uruk legal documents composed in Babylonian on clay
continue through the reigns of Alexander the Great (330-323 BC), his short-lived







dynasty and the Seleucid kings that succeeded it, but are little in evidence after the
Parthian conquest (140 BC). The same can be said for texts that capture in writing the
daily rituals of the great temples, a genre of Late Babylonian writing whose rise is
symptomatic of anxiety about the future of these venerable institutions. At Borsippa
an archive of letter-orders (memoranda from temple administrators) records the
activities of the temple brewers' office at the beginning of the Hellenistic era. The
last surviving archives from the great temples of Uruk date from the early to mid-2nd
century, but an isolated tablet records the temples' existence as late as 108 BC.
Administrative records are more plentiful at Babylon, where they continue beyond
the Seleucid domination into the early 1st century BC. In reporting the continuing
existence of several temples at the old capital, they document the careers of
individual astronomers maintained out of temple funds (Text sample 9).
Astronomical diaries written at Babylon straddle the Persian and Seleucid periods but
fail in the mid- 1st century BC.

The pronunciation of this passage, based on the evidence of roughly
contemporaneous Greek transcriptions of Akkadian, might be something like this:
ultu uw anna sa sattus sina mana kasap kuruwat Ittiwardukbaldt a ablsun ana

From this day forth, every year, we shall pay from our resources two shekels of
silver, the expenses of the aforementioned Itti-Marduk-balatu, their father, to Bel-
ahhe-usur and Nabu-mushetiq-uddi, in accordance with what their father Itti-Marduk-
balatu drew. They will make [diaries of] observations and produce the yearly
astronomical tables together with the astronomers Belshunu, La-abash, Muranu,
Iddin-Bel, Bel-nasirshu, and other astronomers.







Cuneiform scholarship. The number of extant cuneiform tablets of the
Hellenistic period has been estimated at more than two thousand, of which well over
one thousand are of astronomical content (Oelsner 1986: 138). This gives a good
indication of the predominant use to which Akkadian was put in the last centuries of
the cuneiform tradition. Astrologer-astronomers must have formed the majority of
scholars still writing the language at this time. Akkadian in the Seleucid and Parthian
periods was, like Sumerian before it, a scholars' language that had to be learned by a
long apprenticeship. The art of writing it was inextricably bound up with the survival
of the ancient temples and the duties of their personnel, especially the astronomers.
As populations moved away from the old cities to the new royal capitals at Seleucia
and then Ctesiphon, and royal patronage and funding came to an end, these buildings
became increasingly difficult to maintain. At the same time the people that staffed
them and otherwise relied on them for support must have decreased rapidly.

Alongside the diminishing archival documentation of the Persian, Seleucid and
Parthian periods, production of new copies of texts of the old Sumero-Babylonian
scribal tradition continued, especially at Babylon, Borsippa and Uruk. Much of this
was carried out as part of their education by boys and young men learning to write in
order to enter the literate professions. Though few new texts were written, there is
plentiful evidence that in the 4th century BC Akkadian was still the vehicle for a
flourishing intellectual culture, particularly in the exegesis of professional lore
(Frahm 2002). By the Parthian era, however, cuneiform learning was much less
widespread. It was the preserve only of a few families of learned scholars, mostly
astronomers, clinging to the ancient ways in cities that history had passed by. The
latest dated copy of a text of the old scribal tradition known at present was written at
Babylon in 35 BC (Oelsner 2002a: 12). It is an apprentice's manuscript of a literary
prayer to Marduk. Undated copies of literary texts far outnumber dated exemplars
and it is not improbable that we possess many other literary tablets of the same
period. Some may even date from as late as the astronomical almanacs. These
almanacs are, at present, our very last dated cuneiform documents. The most recent of
them contains predictions of planetary movements and other events for AD 75. The
almanacs are ostensibly written in Akkadian and prefaced with a standard scribal
prayer in Babylonian, but whether they had to be read in that language is uncertain:
the stereotyped and abbreviated formulae in which they are couched is a kind of
scholarly code, readable in any language by anyone with a little training.

Whoever wrote the almanacs, however, must have had some grasp of the
Akkadian language, for they were surely trained to write cuneiform in the time-
honoured way, by exposure to the Sumero-Babylonian scribal tradition. Relics from
their education may even survive in the form of school tablets from Babylon that hold
passages of Sumerian and Akkadian texts in cuneiform accompanied by Greek
transcriptions. These have been dated on the basis of palaeography mostly to the two
centuries either side of the turn of the era, but one or two examples may be later still.
Partly on this evidence it has been argued that cuneiform culture, and thus written
Babylonian, survived to the 2nd century AD and even into the 3rd, when many old







traditions were finally extinguished by the religious reforms of the Sasanian Persians,
who had put an end to Parthian rule in Mesopotamia by AD 230 (Geller 1997).

Without a breakthrough in cuneiform palaeography it remains to be seen
whether any of the many undated cuneiform copies of texts from the Late Babylonian
scribal tradition could be as late as the 2nd century AD. As matters stand, this seems
unlikely but it would be unwise completely to discount it. Two events, perhaps
interconnected, contributed greatly to the end of the cuneiform tradition of native
scholarship in Babylonia, and so to the final demise of Akkadian. The transfer of
astronomical writing to a medium other than cuneiform was one (Brown
forthcoming). The decline of the venerable cult-centres was the other. Though there is
evidence that the cults of some of the old gods survived into the 3rd century AD, they
must by then have been relocated. Archaeological excavation shows that the great
temple buildings of Uruk were abandoned and built over soon after about 100 BC, at
all events early in the Parthian period. At Babylon the ancient cult-centre of Marduk
(Bel) and other sanctuaries endured longer. Marduk' s temple was ruined, levelled
into a mound and redeveloped as a residential quarter some time before the Parthian
era closed in the early 3rd century AD.

Some have speculated that a tradition of Sumero-Baby Ionian scholarship —
and with it a reading knowledge of Akkadian — survived the death of the cuneiform
script in Greek and Aramaic transcriptions written on scrolls of papyrus and leather,
now perished (e.g. Oelsner 2002a: 30-1). Late allusions to Babylonian language and
learning, for example by the scholiast who credits the Greek novelist Iamblichus (fl.
AD 200), a native-speaker of Syriac, with a knowledge of the "Babylonian language"
(Geller 1997: 50), might speak for a continuing endurance of learned Akkadian,
whether read from cuneiform tablets or from scrolls. Others have argued, however,
that allusions to Mesopotamian learning in the Roman period refer not to the old
Sumero- Akkadian tradition but to a contemporaneous "pagan Aramaic literature" that
is now lost (Houston et al. 2003: 456). We will probably never know. The end of
written Akkadian, then, is not clearly visible in history.
