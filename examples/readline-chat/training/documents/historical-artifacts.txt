The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.

He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.

He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.

He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.

He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.

He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.

He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.

He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:

For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:

For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:

For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:

For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:

For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:

For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences

For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:

For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:

For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.

He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.

He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.

We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That all forfeitures and penalties incurred after the twenty ninth day of September, one thousand seven hundred and sixty five, for offences committed against an act passed in the fourth year of the reign of his present Majesty, intituled, An act for granting certain duties in the British colonies and plantations in America; for continuing, amending, and making perpetual, an act passed in the sixth year of the reign of his late majesty King George the Second, intituled, An act for the better securing and encouraging the trade of his MajestyÂ’s sugar colonies in America; for applying the produce of such duties, and of the duties to arise by virtue of the said act, towards defraying the expences of defending, protecting, and securing the said colonies and plantations; for explaining an act made in twenty fifth year of the reign of King Charles the Second, intituled, An act for the encouragement of the Greenland and Eastland trades, and for the better securing the plantation trade; and for altering and disallowing several drawbacks on exports from this kingdom, and more effectually preventing the clandestine conveyance of goods to and from the said colonies and plantations, and improving and securing the trade between the same and Great Britain, and for offences committed against any other act or acts of parliament relating to the trade or revenues of the said colonies or plantations; shall and may be prosecuted, sued for, and recovered, in any court of record, or in any court of admiralty, in the respective colony or plantation where the offence shall be committed, or in any court of vice admiralty appointed or to be appointed, and which shall have jurisdiction within such colony, plantation, or place, (which courts of admiralty or vice admiralty are hereby respectively authorized and required to proceed, hear, and determine the same) at the election of the informer or prosecutor.

LVIII. And it is hereby further enacted and declared by the authority aforesaid, That all sums of money granted and imposed by this act as rates or duties, and also all sums of money imposed as forfeitures or penalties, and all sums of money required to be paid, and all other monies herein mentioned, shall be deemed and taken to be sterling money of Great Britain, and shall be collected, recovered, and paid, to the amount of the value which such nominal sums bear in Great Britain; and that such monies shall and may be received and taken, according to the proportion and value of five shillings and six pence the ounce in silver; and that all the forfeitures and penalties hereby inflicted, and which shall be incurred, in the said colonies and plantations, shall and may be prosecuted, sued for, and recovered, in any court of record, or in any court of admiralty, in the respective colony or plantation where the offence shall be committed, or in any court of vice admiralty appointed or to be appointed, and which shall have jurisdiction within such colony, plantation, or place, (which courts of admiralty or vice admiralty are hereby respectively authorized and required to proceed, hear, and determine the same,) at the election of the informer or prosecutor; and that from and after the twenty ninth day of September, one thousand seven hundred and sixty five, in all cases, where any suit or prosecution shall be commenced and determined for any penalty or forfeiture inflicted by this act, or by the same act made in the fourth year of his present MajestyÂ’s reign, or by any other act of parliament relating to the trade or revenues of the said colonies or plantations, in any court of admiralty in the respective colony or plantation where the offence shall be committed, either party, who shall think himself aggrieved by such determination, may appeal from such determination to any court of vice admiralty appointed or to be appointed, and which shall have jurisdiction within such colony, plantation, or place, (which court of vice admiralty is hereby authorized and required to proceed, hear, and determine such appeal) any law, custom, or usage, to the contrary notwithstanding; and the forfeitures and penalties hereby inflicted, which shall be incurred in any other part of his MajestyÂ’s dominions, shall and may be prosecuted, sued for and recovered, with full costs of suit, in any court of record within the kingdom, territory, or place, where the offence shall be committed, in such and the same manner as any debt or damage, to the amount of such forfeiture or penalty, can or may be sued for and recovered.

LIX. And it is hereby further enacted, That all the forfeitures and penalties hereby inflicted shall be divided, paid, and applied, as follows; (that is to say) one third part of all such forfeitures and penalties recovered in the said colonies and plantations, shall be paid into the hands of one of the chief distributors of stamped vellum, parchment, and paper, residing in the colony or plantation wherein the offender shall be convicted, for the use of his Majesty, his heirs, and successors; one third part of the penalties and forfeitures, so recovered, to the governor or commander in chief of such colony or plantation; and the other third part therefore, to the person who shall inform or sue for the same; and that one moiety of all such penalties and forfeitures recovered in any other parts of his MajestyÂ’s dominions, shall be to the use of his Majesty, his heirs, and successors, and the other moiety thereof, to the person who shall inform or sue for the same.

LXI. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That all the present governors or commanders in chief of any British colony or plantation, shall, before the said first day of November, one thousand seven hundred and sixty five, and all who hereafter shall be made governors or commanders in chief of the said colonies or plantations, or any of them, before their entrance into their government, shall take a solemn oath to do their utmost, that all and every clauses contained in this present act be punctually and bona fide observed, according to the true intent and meaning thereof, so far as appertains unto the said governors or commanders in chief respectively, under the like penalties, forfeitures, and disabilities, either for neglecting to take the said oath, or for wittingly neglecting to do their duty accordingly, as are mentioned and expressed in an act made in the seventh and eighth year of the reign of King William the Third, intituled, An act for preventing frauds, and regulating abuses, in the plantation trade; and the said oath hereby required to be taken, shall be administered by such person or persons as hath or have been, or shall be, appointed to administer the oath required to be taken by the said act made in the seventh and eighth year of the reign of King William the Third.

Clauses marked (+) are still valid under the charter of 1225, but with a few minor
amendments. Clauses marked (*) were omitted in all later reissues of the charter. In the
charter itself the clauses are not numbered, and the text reads continuously. The translation
sets out to convey the sense rather than the precise wording of the original Latin.
JOHN, by the grace of God King of England, Lord of Ireland, Duke of Normandy and
Aquitaine, and Count of Anjou, to his archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, barons, justices,
foresters, sheriffs, stewards, servants, and to all his officials and loyal subjects, Greeting.
KNOW THAT BEFORE GOD, for the health of our soul and those of our ancestors and heirs,
to the honour of God, the exaltation of the holy Church, and the better ordering of our
kingdom, at the advice of our reverend fathers Stephen, archbishop of Canterbury, primate
of all England, and cardinal of the holy Roman Church, Henry archbishop of Dublin, William
bishop of London, Peter bishop of Winchester, Jocelin bishop of Bath and Glastonbury, Hugh
bishop of Lincoln, Walter bishop of Worcester, William bishop of Coventry, Benedict bishop
of Rochester, Master Pandulf subdeacon and member of the papal household, Brother
Aymeric master of the knighthood of the Temple in England, William Marshal earl of
Pembroke, William earl of Salisbury, William earl of Warren, William earl of Arundel, Alan of
Galloway constable of Scotland, Warin fitz Gerald, Peter fitz Herbert, Hubert de Burgh
seneschal of Poitou, Hugh de Neville, Matthew fitz Herbert, Thomas Basset, Alan Basset,
Philip Daubeny, Robert de Roppeley, John Marshal, John fitz Hugh, and other loyal subjects:
+ (1) FIRST, THAT WE HAVE GRANTED TO GOD, and by this present charter have
confirmed for us and our heirs in perpetuity, that the English Church shall be free, and shall
have its rights undiminished, and its liberties unimpaired. That we wish this so to be
observed, appears from the fact that of our own free will, before the outbreak of the present
dispute between us and our barons, we granted and confirmed by charter the freedom of the
Church's elections - a right reckoned to be of the greatest necessity and importance to it -
and caused this to be confirmed by Pope Innocent III. This freedom we shall observe
ourselves, and desire to be observed in good faith by our heirs in perpetuity.
TO ALL FREE MEN OF OUR KINGDOM we have also granted, for us and our heirs for ever,
all the liberties written out below, to have and to keep for them and their heirs, of us and our
heirs:
(2) If any earl, baron, or other person that holds lands directly of the Crown, for military
service, shall die, and at his death his heir shall be of full age and owe a 'relief', the heir shall
have his inheritance on payment of the ancient scale of 'relief'. That is to say, the heir or
heirs of an earl shall pay £100 for the entire earl's barony, the heir or heirs of a knight 100s.
at most for the entire knight's 'fee', and any man that owes less shall pay less, in accordance
with the ancient usage of 'fees'.
(3) But if the heir of such a person is under age and a ward, when he comes of age he shall
have his inheritance without 'relief' or fine.
(4) The guardian of the land of an heir who is under age shall take from it only reasonable
revenues, customary dues, and feudal services. He shall do this without destruction or
damage to men or property. If we have given the guardianship of the land to a sheriff, or to
any person answerable to us for the revenues, and he commits destruction or damage, we will exact compensation from him, and the land shall be entrusted to two worthy and prudent
men of the same 'fee', who shall be answerable to us for the revenues, or to the person to
whom we have assigned them. If we have given or sold to anyone the guardianship of such
land, and he causes destruction or damage, he shall lose the guardianship of it, and it shall
be handed over to two worthy and prudent men of the same 'fee', who shall be similarly
answerable to us.
(5) For so long as a guardian has guardianship of such land, he shall maintain the houses,
parks, fish preserves, ponds, mills, and everything else pertaining to it, from the revenues of
the land itself. When the heir comes of age, he shall restore the whole land to him, stocked
with plough teams and such implements of husbandry as the season demands and the
revenues from the land can reasonably bear.
(6) Heirs may be given in marriage, but not to someone of lower social standing. Before a
marriage takes place, it shall be made known to the heir's next-of-kin.
(7) At her husband's death, a widow may have her marriage portion and inheritance at once
and without trouble. She shall pay nothing for her dower, marriage portion, or any inheritance
that she and her husband held jointly on the day of his death. She may remain in her
husband's house for forty days after his death, and within this period her dower shall be
assigned to her.
(8) No widow shall be compelled to marry, so long as she wishes to remain without a
husband. But she must give security that she will not marry without royal consent, if she
holds her lands of the Crown, or without the consent of whatever other lord she may hold
them of.
(9) Neither we nor our officials will seize any land or rent in payment of a debt, so long as the
debtor has movable goods sufficient to discharge the debt. A debtor's sureties shall not be
distrained upon so long as the debtor himself can discharge his debt. If, for lack of means,
the debtor is unable to discharge his debt, his sureties shall be answerable for it. If they so
desire, they may have the debtor's lands and rents until they have received satisfaction for
the debt that they paid for him, unless the debtor can show that he has settled his obligations
to them.
* (10) If anyone who has borrowed a sum of money from Jews dies before the debt has been
repaid, his heir shall pay no interest on the debt for so long as he remains under age,
irrespective of whom he holds his lands. If such a debt falls into the hands of the Crown, it
will take nothing except the principal sum specified in the bond.
* (11) If a man dies owing money to Jews, his wife may have her dower and pay nothing
towards the debt from it. If he leaves children that are under age, their needs may also be
provided for on a scale appropriate to the size of his holding of lands. The debt is to be paid
out of the residue, reserving the service due to his feudal lords. Debts owed to persons other
than Jews are to be dealt with similarly.
* (12) No 'scutage' or 'aid' may be levied in our kingdom without its general consent, unless it
is for the ransom of our person, to make our eldest son a knight, and (once) to marry our
eldest daughter. For these purposes only a reasonable 'aid' may be levied. 'Aids' from the
city of London are to be treated similarly. + (13) The city of London shall enjoy all its ancient liberties and free customs, both by land
and by water. We also will and grant that all other cities, boroughs, towns, and ports shall
enjoy all their liberties and free customs.
* (14) To obtain the general consent of the realm for the assessment of an 'aid' - except in
the three cases specified above - or a 'scutage', we will cause the archbishops, bishops,
abbots, earls, and greater barons to be summoned individually by letter. To those who hold
lands directly of us we will cause a general summons to be issued, through the sheriffs and
other officials, to come together on a fixed day (of which at least forty days notice shall be
given) and at a fixed place. In all letters of summons, the cause of the summons will be
stated. When a summons has been issued, the business appointed for the day shall go
forward in accordance with the resolution of those present, even if not all those who were
summoned have appeared.
* (15) In future we will allow no one to levy an 'aid' from his free men, except to ransom his
person, to make his eldest son a knight, and (once) to marry his eldest daughter. For these
purposes only a reasonable 'aid' may be levied.
(16) No man shall be forced to perform more service for a knight's 'fee', or other free holding
of land, than is due from it.
(17) Ordinary lawsuits shall not follow the royal court around, but shall be held in a fixed
place.
(18) Inquests of novel disseisin, mort d'ancestor, and darrein presentment shall be taken
only in their proper county court. We ourselves, or in our absence abroad our chief justice,
will send two justices to each county four times a year, and these justices, with four knights
of the county elected by the county itself, shall hold the assizes in the county court, on the
day and in the place where the court meets.
(19) If any assizes cannot be taken on the day of the county court, as many knights and
freeholders shall afterwards remain behind, of those who have attended the court, as will
suffice for the administration of justice, having regard to the volume of business to be done.
(20) For a trivial offence, a free man shall be fined only in proportion to the degree of his
offence, and for a serious offence correspondingly, but not so heavily as to deprive him of his
livelihood. In the same way, a merchant shall be spared his merchandise, and a villein the
implements of his husbandry, if they fall upon the mercy of a royal court. None of these fines
shall be imposed except by the assessment on oath of reputable men of the neighbourhood.
(21) Earls and barons shall be fined only by their equals, and in proportion to the gravity of
their offence.
(22) A fine imposed upon the lay property of a clerk in holy orders shall be assessed upon
the same principles, without reference to the value of his ecclesiastical benefice.
(23) No town or person shall be forced to build bridges over rivers except those with an
ancient obligation to do so.
(24) No sheriff, constable, coroners, or other royal officials are to hold lawsuits that should be
held by the royal justices.
* (25) Every county, hundred, wapentake, and tithing shall remain at its ancient rent, without
increase, except the royal demesne manors.
(26) If at the death of a man who holds a lay 'fee' of the Crown, a sheriff or royal official
produces royal letters patent of summons for a debt due to the Crown, it shall be lawful for
them to seize and list movable goods found in the lay 'fee' of the dead man to the value of
the debt, as assessed by worthy men. Nothing shall be removed until the whole debt is paid,
when the residue shall be given over to the executors to carry out the dead man’s will. If no
debt is due to the Crown, all the movable goods shall be regarded as the property of the
dead man, except the reasonable shares of his wife and children.
* (27) If a free man dies intestate, his movable goods are to be distributed by his next-of-kin
and friends, under the supervision of the Church. The rights of his debtors are to be
preserved.
(28) No constable or other royal official shall take corn or other movable goods from any man
without immediate payment, unless the seller voluntarily offers postponement of this.
(29) No constable may compel a knight to pay money for castle-guard if the knight is willing
to undertake the guard in person, or with reasonable excuse to supply some other fit man to
do it. A knight taken or sent on military service shall be excused from castle-guard for the
period of this service.
(30) No sheriff, royal official, or other person shall take horses or carts for transport from any
free man, without his consent.
(31) Neither we nor any royal official will take wood for our castle, or for any other purpose,
without the consent of the owner.
(32) We will not keep the lands of people convicted of felony in our hand for longer than a
year and a day, after which they shall be returned to the lords of the 'fees' concerned.
(33) All fish-weirs shall be removed from the Thames, the Medway, and throughout the
whole of England, except on the sea coast.
(34) The writ called precipe shall not in future be issued to anyone in respect of any holding
of land, if a free man could thereby be deprived of the right of trial in his own lord's court.
(35) There shall be standard measures of wine, ale, and corn (the London quarter),
throughout the kingdom. There shall also be a standard width of dyed cloth, russet, and
haberject, namely two ells within the selvedges. Weights are to be standardised similarly.
(36) In future nothing shall be paid or accepted for the issue of a writ of inquisition of life or
limbs. It shall be given gratis, and not refused.
(37) If a man holds land of the Crown by 'fee-farm', 'socage', or 'burgage', and also holds
land of someone else for knight's service, we will not have guardianship of his heir, nor of the
land that belongs to the other person's 'fee', by virtue of the 'fee-farm', 'socage', or 'burgage',
unless the 'fee-farm' owes knight's service. We will not have the guardianship of a man's
heir, or of land that he holds of someone else, by reason of any small property that he may
hold of the Crown for a service of knives, arrows, or the like.
(38) In future no official shall place a man on trial upon his own unsupported statement,
without producing credible witnesses to the truth of it.
+ (39) No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or
outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any way, nor will we proceed with force
against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgment of his equals or by the
law of the land.
+ (40) To no one will we sell, to no one deny or delay right or justice.
(41) All merchants may enter or leave England unharmed and without fear, and may stay or
travel within it, by land or water, for purposes of trade, free from all illegal exactions, in
accordance with ancient and lawful customs. This, however, does not apply in time of war to
merchants from a country that is at war with us. Any such merchants found in our country at
the outbreak of war shall be detained without injury to their persons or property, until we or
our chief justice have discovered how our own merchants are being treated in the country at
war with us. If our own merchants are safe they shall be safe too.
* (42) In future it shall be lawful for any man to leave and return to our kingdom unharmed
and without fear, by land or water, preserving his allegiance to us, except in time of war, for
some short period, for the common benefit of the realm. People that have been imprisoned
or outlawed in accordance with the law of the land, people from a country that is at war with
us, and merchants - who shall be dealt with as stated above - are excepted from this
provision.
(43) If a man holds lands of any 'escheat' such as the 'honour' of Wallingford, Nottingham,
Boulogne, Lancaster, or of other 'escheats' in our hand that are baronies, at his death his
heir shall give us only the 'relief' and service that he would have made to the baron, had the
barony been in the baron's hand. We will hold the 'escheat' in the same manner as the baron
held it.
(44) People who live outside the forest need not in future appear before the royal justices of
the forest in answer to general summonses, unless they are actually involved in proceedings
or are sureties for someone who has been seized for a forest offence.
* (45) We will appoint as justices, constables, sheriffs, or other officials, only men that know
the law of the realm and are minded to keep it well.
(46) All barons who have founded abbeys, and have charters of English kings or ancient
tenure as evidence of this, may have guardianship of them when there is no abbot, as is their
due.
(47) All forests that have been created in our reign shall at once be disafforested. Riverbanks that have been enclosed in our reign shall be treated similarly.
*(48) All evil customs relating to forests and warrens, foresters, warreners, sheriffs and their
servants, or river-banks and their wardens, are at once to be investigated in every county by
twelve sworn knights of the county, and within forty days of their enquiry the evil customs are
to be abolished completely and irrevocably. But we, or our chief justice if we are not in
England, are first to be informed.

* (49) We will at once return all hostages and charters delivered up to us by Englishmen as
security for peace or for loyal service.
* (50) We will remove completely from their offices the kinsmen of Gerard de Athée, and in
future they shall hold no offices in England. The people in question are Engelard de Cigogné,
Peter, Guy, and Andrew de Chanceaux, Guy de Cigogné, Geoffrey de Martigny and his
brothers, Philip Marc and his brothers, with Geoffrey his nephew, and all their followers.
* (51) As soon as peace is restored, we will remove from the kingdom all the foreign knights,
bowmen, their attendants, and the mercenaries that have come to it, to its harm, with horses
and arms.
* (52) To any man whom we have deprived or dispossessed of lands, castles, liberties, or
rights, without the lawful judgment of his equals, we will at once restore these. In cases of
dispute the matter shall be resolved by the judgment of the twenty-five barons referred to
below in the clause for securing the peace (§61). In cases, however, where a man was
deprived or dispossessed of something without the lawful judgment of his equals by our
father King Henry or our brother King Richard, and it remains in our hands or is held by
others under our warranty, we shall have respite for the period commonly allowed to
Crusaders, unless a lawsuit had been begun, or an enquiry had been made at our order,
before we took the Cross as a Crusader. On our return from the Crusade, or if we abandon
it, we will at once render justice in full.
* (53) We shall have similar respite in rendering justice in connexion with forests that are to
be disafforested, or to remain forests, when these were first afforested by our father Henry or
our brother Richard; with the guardianship of lands in another person's 'fee', when we have
hitherto had this by virtue of a 'fee' held of us for knight's service by a third party; and with
abbeys founded in another person's 'fee', in which the lord of the 'fee' claims to own a right.
On our return from the Crusade, or if we abandon it, we will at once do full justice to
complaints about these matters.
(54) No one shall be arrested or imprisoned on the appeal of a woman for the death of any
person except her husband.
* (55) All fines that have been given to us unjustly and against the law of the land, and all
fines that we have exacted unjustly, shall be entirely remitted or the matter decided by a
majority judgment of the twenty-five barons referred to below in the clause for securing the
peace (§61) together with Stephen, archbishop of Canterbury, if he can be present, and such
others as he wishes to bring with him. If the archbishop cannot be present, proceedings shall
continue without him, provided that if any of the twenty-five barons has been involved in a
similar suit himself, his judgment shall be set aside, and someone else chosen and sworn in
his place, as a substitute for the single occasion, by the rest of the twenty-five.
(56) If we have deprived or dispossessed any Welshmen of land, liberties, or anything else in
England or in Wales, without the lawful judgment of their equals, these are at once to be
returned to them. A dispute on this point shall be determined in the Marches by the judgment
of equals. English law shall apply to holdings of land in England, Welsh law to those in
Wales, and the law of the Marches to those in the Marches. The Welsh shall treat us and
ours in the same way.
* (57) In cases where a Welshman was deprived or dispossessed of anything, without the
lawful judgment of his equals, by our father King Henry or our brother King Richard, and it remains in our hands or is held by others under our warranty, we shall have respite for the
period commonly allowed to Crusaders, unless a lawsuit had been begun, or an enquiry had
been made at our order, before we took the Cross as a Crusader. But on our return from the
Crusade, or if we abandon it, we will at once do full justice according to the laws of Wales
and the said regions.
* (58) We will at once return the son of Llywelyn, all Welsh hostages, and the charters
delivered to us as security for the peace.
* (59) With regard to the return of the sisters and hostages of Alexander, king of Scotland,
his liberties and his rights, we will treat him in the same way as our other barons of England,
unless it appears from the charters that we hold from his father William, formerly king of
Scotland, that he should be treated otherwise. This matter shall be resolved by the judgment
of his equals in our court.
(60) All these customs and liberties that we have granted shall be observed in our kingdom
in so far as concerns our own relations with our subjects. Let all men of our kingdom,
whether clergy or laymen, observe them similarly in their relations with their own men.
* (61) SINCE WE HAVE GRANTED ALL THESE THINGS for God, for the better ordering of
our kingdom, and to allay the discord that has arisen between us and our barons, and since
we desire that they shall be enjoyed in their entirety, with lasting strength, for ever, we give
and grant to the barons the following security:
The barons shall elect twenty-five of their number to keep, and cause to be observed with all
their might, the peace and liberties granted and confirmed to them by this charter.
If we, our chief justice, our officials, or any of our servants offend in any respect against any
man, or transgress any of the articles of the peace or of this security, and the offence is
made known to four of the said twenty-five barons, they shall come to us - or in our absence
from the kingdom to the chief justice - to declare it and claim immediate redress. If we, or in
our absence abroad the chief justice, make no redress within forty days, reckoning from the
day on which the offence was declared to us or to him, the four barons shall refer the matter
to the rest of the twenty-five barons, who may distrain upon and assail us in every way
possible, with the support of the whole community of the land, by seizing our castles, lands,
possessions, or anything else saving only our own person and those of the queen and our
children, until they have secured such redress as they have determined upon. Having
secured the redress, they may then resume their normal obedience to us.
Any man who so desires may take an oath to obey the commands of the twenty-five barons
for the achievement of these ends, and to join with them in assailing us to the utmost of his
power. We give public and free permission to take this oath to any man who so desires, and
at no time will we prohibit any man from taking it. Indeed, we will compel any of our subjects
who are unwilling to take it to swear it at our command.
If one of the twenty-five barons dies or leaves the country, or is prevented in any other way
from discharging his duties, the rest of them shall choose another baron in his place, at their
discretion, who shall be duly sworn in as they were.
In the event of disagreement among the twenty-five barons on any matter referred to them
for decision, the verdict of the majority present shall have the same validity as a unanimous verdict of the whole twenty-five, whether these were all present or some of those summoned
were unwilling or unable to appear.
The twenty-five barons shall swear to obey all the above articles faithfully, and shall cause
them to be obeyed by others to the best of their power.
We will not seek to procure from anyone, either by our own efforts or those of a third party,
anything by which any part of these concessions or liberties might be revoked or diminished.
Should such a thing be procured, it shall be null and void and we will at no time make use of
it, either ourselves or through a third party.
* (62) We have remitted and pardoned fully to all men any ill-will, hurt, or grudges that have
arisen between us and our subjects, whether clergy or laymen, since the beginning of the
dispute. We have in addition remitted fully, and for our own part have also pardoned, to all
clergy and laymen any offences committed as a result of the said dispute between Easter in
the sixteenth year of our reign (i.e. 1215) and the restoration of peace.
In addition we have caused letters patent to be made for the barons, bearing witness to this
security and to the concessions set out above, over the seals of Stephen archbishop of
Canterbury, Henry archbishop of Dublin, the other bishops named above, and Master
Pandulf.
* (63) IT IS ACCORDINGLY OUR WISH AND COMMAND that the English Church shall be
free, and that men in our kingdom shall have and keep all these liberties, rights, and
concessions, well and peaceably in their fullness and entirety for them and their heirs, of us
and our heirs, in all things and all places for ever.
Both we and the barons have sworn that all this shall be observed in good faith and without
deceit. Witness the abovementioned people and many others.
Given by our hand in the meadow that is called Runnymede, between Windsor and Staines,
on the fifteenth day of June in the seventeenth year of our reign (i.e. 1215: the new regnal
year began on 28 May).
