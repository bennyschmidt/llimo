Everything Maths



Mathematics is commonly thought of as being about numbers but mathematics is actually a language!
Mathematics is the language that nature speaks to us in. As we learn to understand and speak this lan-
guage, we can discover many of nature's secrets. Just as understanding someone's language is necessary
to learn more about them, mathematics is required to learn about all aspects of the world - whether it
is physical sciences, life sciences or even finance and economics.

The great writers and poets of the world have the ability to draw on words and put them together in ways
that can tell beautiful or inspiring stories. In a similar way, one can draw on mathematics to explain and
create new things. Many of the modern technologies that have enriched our lives are greatly dependent
on mathematics. DVDs, Google searches, bank cards with PIN numbers are just some examples. And
just as words were not created specifically to tell a story but their existence enabled stories to be told, so
the mathematics used to create these technologies was not developed for its own sake, but was available
to be drawn on when the time for its application was right.

There is in fact not an area of life that is not affected by mathematics. Many of the most sought after
careers depend on the use of mathematics. Civil engineers use mathematics to determine how to best
design new structures; economists use mathematics to describe and predict how the economy will react
to certain changes; investors use mathematics to price certain types of shares or calculate how risky
particular investments are; software developers use mathematics for many of the algorithms (such as
Google searches and data security) that make programmes useful.

But, even in our daily lives mathematics is everywhere - in our use of distance, time and money.
Mathematics is even present in art, design and music as it informs proportions and musical tones. The
greater our ability to understand mathematics, the greater our ability to appreciate beauty and everything
in nature. Far from being just a cold and abstract discipline, mathematics embodies logic, symmetry,
harmony and technological progress. More than any other language, mathematics is everywhere and
universal in its application.

The Language of Mathematics



The purpose of any language, like English or Zulu, is to make it possible for people to communicate.
All languages have an alphabet, which is a group of letters that are used to make up words. There are
also rules of grammar which explain how words are supposed to be used to build up sentences. This
is needed because when a sentence is written, the person reading the sentence understands exactly
what the writer is trying to explain. Punctuation marks (like a full stop or a comma) are used to further
clarify what is written.

Mathematics is a language, specifically it is the language of Science. Like any language, mathematics
has letters (known as numbers) that are used to make up words (known as expressions), and sentences
(known as equations). The punctuation marks of mathematics are the different signs and symbols that
are used, for example, the plus sign (+), the minus sign (â€” ), the multiplication sign (x), the equals sign
(=) and so on. There are also rules that explain how the numbers should be used together with the
signs to make up equations that express some meaning.

Logarithms





2. 1 Introduction




In mathematics many ideas are related. We saw that addition and subtraction are related and that
multiplication and division are related. Similarly, exponentials and logarithms are related.

Logarithms, commonly referred to as logs, are the inverse of exponentials. The logarithm of a number
x in the base a is defined as the number n such that a n = x.



So, if a" = x, then:

log (x) = n

Â© See introductory video: VMgio at www.everythingmaths.co.za



(2.1)




2.2 Definition of Logarithms




The logarithm of a number is the value to which the base must be raised to give that number i.e. the
exponent. From the first example of the activity log 2 (4) means the power of 2 that will give 4. As
2 2 = 4, we see that

log 2 (4) = 2 (2.2)

The exponential-form is then 2 2 = 4 and the logarithmic-form is log 2 4 = 2.



DEFINITION: Logarithms



If a" = x, then: log a (:r) = n, where a > 0; a ^ 1 and x > 0.



Activity.



Logarithm Symbols



Write the following out in words. The first one is done for you.
1 . log 2 (4) islogtothebase2of4

2- log 10 (14)

3- log 16 (4)

4. log, (8)

5. log,, (a;)



CHAPTER 2. LOGARITHMS

Activity:



Applying the definition



Find the value of:
1. log 7 343



2. log 2 8
3- log 4 i
4. log 10 1 000



Reasoning :

7 3 = 343

therefore, log 7 343 = 3




2.3 Logarithm Bases




Logarithms, like exponentials, also have a base and log 2 (2) is not the same as log 10 (2).

We generally use the "common" base, 10, or the natural base, e.

The number e is an irrational number between 2.71 and 2.72. It comes up surprisingly often in Math-
ematics, but for now suffice it to say that it is one of the two common bases.



Extension:



Natural Logarithm



The natural logarithm (symbol In) is widely used in the sciences. The natural logarithm is to
the base e which is approximately 2.71828183 .... e, like tt and is an example of an irrational
number.



While the notation log 10 (a;) and log e (x) may be used, log 10 (x) is often written log(x) in Science and
log e (x) is normally written as ln(x) in both Science and Mathematics. So, if you see the log symbol
without a base, it means log 10 .

It is often necessary or convenient to convert a log from one base to another. An engineer might need
an approximate solution to a log in a base for which he does not have a table or calculator function,
or it may be algebraically convenient to have two logs in the same base.

Logarithms can be changed from one base to another, by using the change of base formula:

logtz



logâ€ž x



log;, a



(2.3)



where b is any base you find convenient. Normally a and 6 are known, therefore log,, a is normally a
known, if irrational, number.



For example, change log 2 12 in base 10 is:



log, 12



logic 12

Change of Base



Change the following to the indicated base:

1 . log 2 (4) to base 8

2. log 1(1 (14) to base 2

3. log 16 (4) to base 10

4. log x (8) to base y

5. log (x) to base x

2.4 Laws of Logarithms




Just as for the exponents, logarithms have some laws which make working with them easier. These
laws are based on the exponential laws and are summarised first and then explained in detail.

4. log 1000 = 3



2.7



CHAPTER 2. LOGARITHMS




2.7 Logarithm Law 3:

log a (x-2/) = log a (x) + log a (y)




The derivation of this law is a bit trickier than the first two. Firstly, we need to relate x and y to the
base a. So, assume that x = a m and y = a". Then from Equation 2.1, we have that:

log a (x) = m (2.10)

and logjy) = n (2.11)

This means that we can write:

log a (Â»â€¢!/) = log a (a m .a")

= log a (a m+ ") (Exponential Law Equation (Grade 10))

= log a (a log " 0E)+log " (: " ) ) (From Equation 2.10 and Equation 2.1 1)

= log (x) + log a (y) (From Equation 2.1)

For example, show that log(10 . 100) = log 10 + log 100. Start with calculating the left hand side:

log(10.100) = log(1000)
= log(10 3 )
= 3

The right hand side:

log 10 + log 100 = 1 + 2
= 3
Both sides are equal. Therefore, log(10 . 100) = log 10 + log 100.



Activity.



Logarithm Law 3: log Q (x . y) = log (jc) + log (y)



Write as separate logs:

1. log 2 (8x4)

2. log 8 (10 x 10)
3- log l6 (xy)

4. \og z {2xy)
5- log, fe 2 )



2.8 Logarithm Law 4:

lQ ga (J) = lQ ga(^) - l0g a (2/)



EMCI



The derivation of this law is identical to the derivation of Logarithm Law 3 and is left as an exercise.
For example, show that log(^jjj) = log 10 â€” log 100. Start with calculating the left hand side:

1

logClO- 1 )

logf^)

s \100J



ll Â«



CHAPTER 2. LOGARITHMS



2.9



The right hand side:



log 10 - log 100 = 1-2
= -1



Both sides are equal. Therefore, log(j^) = log 10 â€” log 100.



Activity:



Logarithm Law 4: log a ( | J = log a (a;) - logâ€ž(y)



Write as separate logs:
1. log 2 (|)

2- log 8 (^)

3- log 16 (f)

4- log 2 (f)

5- log x (|)



2.9 Logarithm Law 5:

lo ga(^) = bhg a {x




Once again, we need to relate x to the base a. So, we let x = a m . Then,

loga^') = lÂ°ga (( a m ) b )

= log a (a m ' ) (Exponential Law in Equation (Grade 10))

But, m = log a (x) (Assumption that x = a m )

.; logjz 6 ) = ]ogâ€ž(a'- to Â«- W )

= b.log a (x) (Definition of logarithm in Equation 2.1)

For example, we can show that log 2 (5 3 ) = 31og 2 (5).
log 2 (5 3 ) = log 2 (5.5.5)



log 2 5 + log 2 5 + log 2 5 (â– .â–  log a (:r . y) = log Q (a . a ))
3 log, 5



Therefore, log 2 (5 3 ) = 31og 2 (5).



Activity:



Logarithm Law 5: log a (z 6 ) = blog a (x)



Simplify the following:

1. log 2 (8 4 )

2. log 8 (10 10 )

3. log 16 (x")

4- iog z (y x )

5- log,(2/ 2x )



2.10



CHAPTER 2. LOGARITHMS




2.10 Logarithm Law 6:




The derivation of this law is identical to the derivation of Logarithm Law 5 and is left as an exercise.
For example, we can show that log 2 (-v / 5) = Â° s 3 .



log 2 (^5) = log 2 (5*)

log 2 5



log 2 5 (â– .' log^a/") = 61og a (:r))

2. / / Solving Simple Log Equations




In Grade 10 you solved some exponential equations by trial and error, because you did not know the
great power of logarithms yet. Now it is much easier to solve these equations by using logarithms.

For example to solve x in 25 x = 50 correct to two decimal places you simply apply the following
reasoning. IftheLHS = RHS then the logarithm of the LHS must be equal to the logarithm of the RHS.
By applying Law 5, you will be able to use your calculator to solve for x.



Example 4: Solving Log equations



QUESTION



Solve for x: 25* = 50 correct to two decimal places.



12



CHAPTER 2. LOGARITHMS 2.11



SOLUTION



Step 1 : Taking the log of both sides

log 25 x = log 50

Step 2 : Use Law 5

x log 25 = log 50

Step 3 : Solve for x

x = log 50 â€” log 25
x = 1,21533...

Step 4 : Round off to required decimal place

x = 1,22



In general, the exponential equation should be simplified as much as possible. Then the aim is to
make the unknown quantity (i.e. x) the subject of the equation.

For example, the equation

is solved by moving all terms with the unknown to one side of the equation and taking all constants to
the other side of the equation

2 X . 2 2 = 1
1

2 = 2^

Then, take the logarithm of each side.

log (2*) = log(l

slog (2) = -log(2 2 )

x log (2) = -2 log (2) Divide both sides by log (2)
.'. x = -2



2+2 = 2Â° = 1 /



Substituting into the original equation, yields
Similarly, 9 (1 ~ 2a,) = 3 4 is solved as follows:

g(l-2x) _ g4

o2(l-2i) n4

32-4* _ 3 4 take the | g ar j tnm f both sides

log(3 2 - 4 *) = log(3 4 )

(2 - ix) log(3) = 41og(3) divide both sides by log(3)

2 - Ax = 4

-Ax = 2

1

:.x = --

Substituting into the original equation, yields

g(l-2(^l)) _ g(l + l) _ 3 2(2) _ g4 j

There are two possible bases: 5 and 7. x is an exponent of 5.

Logarithms are part of a number of formulae used in the Physical Sciences. There are formulae that
deal with earthquakes, with sound, and pH-levels to mention a few. To work out time periods is growth
or decay, logs are used to solve the particular equation.



Example 6: Using the growth formula



QUESTION


A city grows 5% every two years.


How long will it take for the city to triple its size?


SOLUTION






Step 1


Use the formula








A = P(l + i) n As


ume P = x, then A = 3x. For this example


n represents a




period of 2 years, therefore the n is halved for this purpose.




Step 2


Substitute information given into formula

So it will take approximately 45 years for the population to triple


in size.

Sequences and Series





3. 1 Introduction




In this chapter we extend the arithmetic and quadratic sequences studied in earlier grades, to geometric
sequences. We also look at series, which are the summing of the terms in sequences.

Â© See introductory video: VMgjm at www.everythingmaths.co.za




3.2 Arithmetic Sequences



The simplest type of numerical sequence is an arithmetic sequence.



DEFINITION: Arithmetic Sequence

An arithmetic (or linear) sequence is a sequence of numbers in which each new term
is calculated by adding a constant value to the previous term



For example,

1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; . . .

is an arithmetic sequence because you add 1 to the current term to get the next term:



first term

second term

third term



2 = 1 + 1

3 = 2+1



n th term: n = (n - 1) + 1



Activity:

General Equation for the n th -Term of an
Arithmetic Sequence



EMCP



More formally, the number we start out with is called ai (the first term), and the difference between
each successive term is denoted d, called the common difference.

The general arithmetic sequence looks like:



ai


=


fli


a 2


=


Qi + d


03


=


0,2 + d = (qi + d) + d = a\ + 2d


cu


=


a-i + d = (qi + 2d) + d = a\ + 3d


a n


=


ai + d . (n â€” 1)



Thus, the equation for the ri"'-term is:



aâ€ž = ai + d. (n â€” 1)



(3.1)



Given ai and the common difference, d, the entire set of numbers belonging to an arithmetic sequence
can be generated.



Tip



Test for Arithmetic Se-
quences



DEFINITION: Arithmetic Sequence

An arithmetic (or linear) sequence is a sequence of numbers in which each new term
is calculated by adding a constant value to the previous term:



aâ€ž = aâ€ž_i + d



(3.2)



where



aâ€ž represents the new term, the n" l -term, that is calculated;
aâ€ž_i represents the previous term, the (n â€” l)"*-term;
d represents some constant.



A simple test for an arithmetic sequence is to check that the difference between consecutive terms is
constant:



ai â€” ai = a,3 â€” a 2 = a n â€” a n -\ = d



(3.3)



This is quite an important equation, and is the definitive test for an arithmetic sequence. If this condi-
tion does not hold, the sequence is not an arithmetic sequence.

CHAPTER 3. SEQUENCES AND SERIES

Extension:



Plotting a graph of terms in an arithmetic sequence



Plotting a graph of the terms of a sequence sometimes helps in determining the type of se-
quence involved. For an arithmetic sequence, plotting oâ€ž vs. n results in:



a n = Qi + d(n â€” 1)




(Note that the graph will only be a straight line if the sequence is arithmetic.)




3.3 Geometric Sequences




DEFINITION: Geometric Sequences

A geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers in which each new term (except for
the first term) is calculated by multiplying the previous term by a constant value.



This means that the ratio between consecutive numbers in the geometric sequence is a constant. We
will explain what we mean by ratio after looking at the following example.

CHAPTER 3. SEQUENCES AND SERIES



Example - A Flu Epidemic



EMCR



Extension:



What is influenza?



Influenza (commonly called "flu") is caused by the influenza virus, which infects the respiratory
tract (nose, throat, lungs). It can cause mild to severe illness that most of us get during winter
time. The main way that the influenza virus is spread is from person to person in respiratory
droplets of coughs and sneezes. (This is called "droplet spread".) This can happen when
droplets from a cough or sneeze of an infected person are propelled (generally, up to a metre)
through the air and deposited on the mouth or nose of people nearby. It is good practise to
cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze so as not to infect others around you when you
have the flu.



Assume that you have the flu virus, and you forgot to cover your mouth when two friends came to visit
while you were sick in bed. They leave, and the next day they also have the flu. Let's assume that they
in turn spread the virus to two of their friends by the same droplet spread the following day. Assuming
this pattern continues and each sick person infects 2 other friends, we can represent these events in
the following manner:




A A A. A.

ijjiijjiffijjiijjiijpijji



Figure 3.1 : Each person infects two more people with the flu virus.



Again we can tabulate the events and formulate an equation for the general case:



Day, n


Number of newly-infected people


1


2=2


2


4 =2x2 = 2x2'


3


8 =2x4 = 2x2x2 = 2x2'


4


16 = 2x8 = 2x2x2x2 = 2x2^


5


32 = 2 x 16 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 2 x 2 4






n


= 2x2x2x2x---x2 = 2x 2"~ x



The above table represents the number of newly-infected people after n days since you first infected
your 2 friends.



22



CHAPTER 3. SEQUENCES AND SERIES



3.3



You sneeze and the virus is carried over to 2 people who start the chain (on = 2). The next day, each
one then infects 2 of their friends. Now 4 people are newly-infected. Each of them infects 2 people the
third day, and 8 people are infected, and so on. These events can be written as a geometric sequence:

2; 4; 8; 16; 32; ...



Note the common ratio (2) between the events. Recall from the linear arithmetic sequence how the
common difference between terms was established. In the geometric sequence we can determine the
common ratio, r, from



a >



0.2



Or, more generally,



(3.4)

General Equation for the n th -Term of a Ge-
ometric Sequence



EMCS



From the flu example above we know that ai = 2 and r = 2, and we have seen from the table that the
n"*-term is given by aâ€ž = 2 x 2 n_1 . Thus, in general,



aâ€ž = ai . r



(3.6)



where ai is the first term and r is called the common ratio.

So, if we want to know how many people are newly-infected after 1 days, we need to work out aw:

n-l
aâ€ž = a\ .r

a w = 2 x 2 10 - 1

= 2 x 2 9

= 2 x 512

= 1024

That is, after 10 days, there are 1 024 newly-infected people.

3.4 Recursive Formulae for
Sequences



When discussing arithmetic and quadratic sequences, we noticed that the difference between two
consecutive terms in the sequence could be written in a general way.

For an arithmetic sequence, where a new term is calculated by taking the previous term and adding a
constant value, d:

aâ€ž = a n -i + d

The above equation is an example of a recursive equation since we can calculate the n'^-term only by
considering the previous term in the sequence. Compare this with Equation (3.1),



aâ€ž = oi + d. (n â€” 1)



(3.7)



where one can directly calculate the n"'-term of an arithmetic sequence without knowing previous
terms.

For quadratic sequences, we noticed the difference between consecutive terms is given by (??):

aâ€ž - aâ€ž_i = D . (n â€” 2) + d

Therefore, we re-write the equation as

oâ€ž = On-i + D . (n - 2) + d (3.8)

which is then a recursive equation for a quadratic sequence with common second difference, D.
Using (3.5), the recursive equation for a geometric sequence is:

aâ€ž = r . a.n-i (3.9)



Recursive equations are extremely powerful: you can work out every term in the series just by knowing
previous terms. As you can see from the examples above, working out a n using the previous term aâ€ž_i
can be a much simpler computation than working out aâ€ž from scratch using a general formula. This
means that using a recursive formula when using a computer to work out a sequence would mean the
computer would finish its calculations significantly quicker.



Activity:



Recursive Formula



Write the first five terms of the following sequences, given their recursive formulae:

1 . a n = 2a n -i + 3, cl\ = 1

2. a n = Onâ€” i,cn â€” 11

3. a n = 2a n _ 1 ,ai = 2



Extension:



The Fibonacci Sequence



Consider the following sequence:

0; 1; 1; 2; 3; 5; 8; 13; 21; 34;



(3.10)



The above sequence is called the Fibonacci sequence. Each new term is calculated by adding



3.5



CHAPTER 3. SEQUENCES AND SERIES



the previous two terms. Hence, we can write down the recursive equation:

aâ€ž = aâ€ž-i + a n -2 (3.11)




3.5 Series




In this section we simply work on the concept of adding up the numbers belonging to arithmetic and
geometric sequences. We call the sum of any sequence of numbers a series.



Some Basics



EMCV



If we add up the terms of a sequence, we obtain what is called a series. If we only sum a finite number
of terms, we get a fin ite series. We use the symbol Sâ€ž to mean the sum of the first n terms of a sequence
{ai; a2; 03; . . . ;a n }:



On



ai + 0.2 + a 3 + â–  â–  â–  + aâ€ž



(3.12)



For example, if we have the following sequence of numbers

1; 4; 9; 25; 36; 49; ...
and we wish to find the sum of the first four terms, then we write

Si = 1 + 4 + 9 + 25 = 39
The above is an example of a finite series since we are only summing four terms.
If we sum infinitely many terms of a sequence, we get an infinite series:

Son = ai + 0-2 + a 3 + . . .



(3.13)



Sigma Notation



EMCW



In this section we introduce a notation that will make our lives a little easier.

A sum may be written out using the summation symbol J^ â€¢ This symbol is sigma, which is the capital
letter "S" in the Greek alphabet. It indicates that you must sum the expression to the right of it:



Y.Â°-



Om + Om+1 + â–  â–  â–  + Un-1 + O n



(3.14)



where



is the index of the sum;



2(i



CHAPTER 3. SEQUENCES AND SERIES 3.5

â€¢ to is the lower bound (or start index), shown below the summation symbol;

â€¢ n is the upper bound (or end index), shown above the summation symbol;

â€¢ a; is a term of a sequence.

The index i increases from m to n in steps of 1.

If we are summing from i = 1 (which implies summing from the first term in a sequence), then we can
use either Sâ€ž- or ^-notation since they mean the same thing:

n

Sâ€ž = ^^ o,i = 0.1 + a-2 + â–  â–  â–  + a n (3.15)

For example, in the following sum,

5

Â£*

we have to add together all the terms in the sequence a % = i from i = 1 up until i = 5:

5

^j= 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15

3.6 Finite Arithmetic Series




Remember that an arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers, such that the difference between
any term and the previous term is a constant number, d, called the constant difference:



aâ€ž = ai + d (n â€” 1)



(3.18)



where



â€¢ n is the index of the sequence;

â€¢ aâ€ž is the n^-term of the sequence;

â€¢ ai is the first term;

â€¢ d is the common difference.

When we sum a finite number of terms in an arithmetic sequence, we get a finite arithmetic series.

A simple arithmetic sequence is when ai = 1 and d = in the general form (3.18); in other words all
the terms in the sequence are 1:

ai = ai + d (i â€” 1)

= l + 0.(i-l)

= 1

{a,} = {1; 1; 1; 1; 1; ...}

If we wish to sum this sequence from i = 1 to any positive integer n, we would write

n n

^ ai = ^l = l + l + H hi (n times)



2S



CHAPTER 3. SEQUENCES AND SERIES



3.6



Because all the terms are equal to 1, it means that if we sum to n we will be adding ?i-number of l's
together, which is simply equal to n:



Ei



(3.19)



Another simple arithmetic sequence is when <n = 1 and d = I, which is the sequence of positive
integers:

a; = ai + d (i â€” 1)

= 1 + 1 . (* - 1)

= i

{a,} = {1; 2; 3; 4; 5; ...}

If we wish to sum this sequence from i = 1 to any positive integer re, we would write



Y^i= 1 + 2 + 3



(3.20)



This is an equation with a very important solution as it gives the answer to the sum of positive integers.
We first write Sâ€ž as a sum of terms in ascending order:



Sâ€ž = 1 + 2 + h (n - 1) + n

We then write the same sum but with the terms in descending order:

S n = n + {n - 1) + h 2 + 1



(3.21)



(3.22)



We then add corresponding pairs of terms from Equations (3.21) and (3.22), and we find that the sum
for each pair is the same, (n + 1):

2 S n = (n + 1) + (n + 1) + â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ + (n + 1) + (n + 1) (3.23)

We then have re-number of (n + l)-terms, and by simplifying we arrive at the final result:

2 S n = re (re + 1)
Sn = |(n + l)



S n = ^2 i = - (n + 1)



(3.24)



Note that this is an example of a quadratic sequence.



FACT



Mathematician, Karl

Friedrich Gauss, discov-
ered this proof when
he was only 8 years
old. His teacher had
decided to give his
class a problem which
would distract them
for the entire day by
asking them to add
all the numbers from
1 to 100. Young Karl
realised how to do this
almost instantaneously
and shocked the teacher
with the correct answer,
5050.




If we wish to sum any arithmetic sequence, there is no need to work it out term-for-term. We will now
determine the general formula to evaluate a finite arithmetic series. We start with the general formula

CHAPTER 3. SEQUENCES AND SERIES



for an arithmetic sequence and sum it from i = 1 to any positive integer n:

n n

Y^a t = ^[oi+d(i-l)]
i=l i=l

n

= / (a-i + di â€” d)

n

= Yl K ai - d )+ d{ \

n n

= $^(ai-d) + X)(di)

i=l i=l

n n

= J2 ( ai - d ) + d J2 l

i a tin , , .

= (ai â€” d)n+ â€” (n + 1)

= - (2oi - 2d + dn + d)

= â€” (2oi + dn â€” d)

= ^[2oi+d(n-l)]

So, the general formula for determining an arithmetic series is given by

Sn = J2 [ai+d{i-l)] = ^ [2oi+d(n-l)]



(3.25)



For example, if we wish to know the series S20 for the arithmetic sequence a; = 3 + 7 (i â€” 1), we
could either calculate each term individually and sum them:



^'20



Â£[3 + 7(i-l)



= 3 + 10 + 17 + 24 + 31 + 38 + 45 + 52 +
59 + 66 + 73 + 80 + 87 + 94 + 101 +
108+ 115 + 122+ 129 + 136

= 1390

or, more sensibly, we could use Equation (3.25) noting that 01 = 3, d = 7 and n = 20 so that

20
S 20 = X> + 7(i-l)]

= f [2.3 + 7(20-1)]
= 1390

This example demonstrates how useful Equation (3.25) is.

3.7 Finite Squared Series




When we sum a finite number of terms in a quadratic sequence, we get a finite quadratic series. The
general form of a quadratic series is quite complicated, so we will only look at the simple case when
D = 2 and d = (02 â€” ai) = 3, where D is the common second difference and d is the first difference.
This is the sequence of squares of the integers:

â–  2
o-i = 1

{a,} = {l 2 ; 2 2 ; 3 2 ; 4 2 ; 5 2 ; 6 2 ; . . .}

= {1; 4; 9; 16; 25; 36; ...}

If we wish to sum this sequence and create a series, we write

n

Sn = J2 * 2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + â– â– â–  + n

1 1

which can be written, in general, as



Sâ€ž = ^Y = ^(2n + l)(n + l)
1=1



The proof for Equation (3.26) can be found under the Extension block that follows:



(3.26)

Derivation of the Finite Squared Series

Sâ€ž = ^y = l + 4 + 9 + --- + n 2

3.8 F/n/te Geometric Series




When we sum a known number of terms in a geometric sequence, we get a finite geometric series.
We can write out each term of a geometric sequence in the general form:



aâ€ž = ai . r



(3.27)



where



n is the index of the sequence;

a n is the n' h -term of the sequence;

ai is the first term;

r is the common ratio (the ratio of any term to the previous term).



32



CHAPTER 3. SEQUENCES AND SERIES 3.8

By simply adding together the first n terms, we are actually writing out the series

S n = ai + ai r + ai r + â–  â–  â–  + ai r n ~~ + ai r n ~ (3.28)

We may multiply the above equation by r on both sides, giving us

rSn = air + air + air + â–  â–  â–  + ai r n + Qi r" (3.29)

You may notice that all the terms on the right side of (3.28) and (3.29) are the same, except the first
and last terms. If we subtract (3.28) from (3.29), we are left with just

rSâ€ž â€” Sâ€ž = ai r n â€” ai
S n {r-l) = ai(r n -l)

Dividing by (r â€” 1) on both sides, we arrive at the general form of a geometric series:

â€¢A |_! ai (r n - 1)

i = > ai.r = (3.30)

i. â€” ( r â€” 1

3.9 Infinite Series




Thus far we have been working only with finite sums, meaning that whenever we determined the
sum of a series, we only considered the sum of the first n terms. In this section, we consider what
happens when we add infinitely many terms together. You might think that this is a silly question -
surely the answer will be oo when one sums infinitely many numbers, no matter how small they are?
The surprising answer is that while in some cases one will reach oo (like when you try to add all the
positive integers together), there are some cases in which one will get a finite answer. If you don't
believe this, try doing the following sum, a geometric series, on your calculator or computer:



You might think that if you keep adding more and more terms you will eventually get larger and larger
numbers, but in fact you won't even get past 1 - try it and see for yourself!

We denote the sum of an infinite number of terms of a sequence by



Y. a >



When we sum the terms of a series, and the answer we get after each summation gets closer and closer
to some number, we say that the series converges. If a series does not converge, then we say that it
diverges.



Infinite Geometric Series



EMCAC



There is a simple test for knowing instantly which geometric series converges and which diverges.
When r, the common ratio, is strictly between â€”1 and 1, i.e. â€” 1 < r < 1, the infinite series will
converge, otherwise it will diverge. There is also a formula for working out the value to which the
series converges.

Let's start off with Formula (3.30) for the finite geometric series:



I>i-

Finance





4. 1 Introduction




In earlier grades simple interest and compound interest were studied, together with the concept of
depreciation. Nominal and effective interest rates were also described. Since this chapter expands on
earlier work, it would be best if you revised the work done in Grades 10 and 1 1,

When you master the techniques in this chapter, you will be able to assess critically how to invest
your money when you start working and earning. And when you are looking at applying for a bond
from a bank to buy a home, you will confidently be able to get out the calculator and work out how
much you could actually save by making additional repayments. This chapter will provide you with
the fundamental concepts you will need to manage your finances.

Â© See introductory video: VMgmf at www.everythingmaths.co.za




4.2 Finding the Length of the
Investment or Loan



In Grade 1 1, we used the Compound Interest formula A = P(l + i) n to determine the term of the
investment or loan, by trial and error. Remember that P is the initial amount, A is the current amount,
i is the interest rate and n is the number of time units (number of months or years). So if we invest an
amount and know what the interest rate is, then we can work out how long it will take for the money
to grow to the required amount.

Now that you have learnt about logarithms, you are ready to work out the proper algebraic solution. If
you need to remind yourself how logarithms work, go to Chapter 2 (on Page 4).

The basic finance equation is:

A = P.(l + i) n

If you don't know what A, P, i and n represent, then you should definitely revise the work from Grade
10 and 11.

Solving for n:

A = P{l + i) n

(l + i)Â» = (A/P)

log((l+*) n ) = log(A/P)

nlog(l + i) = log(A/P)

n = log(A/P)/log(l + i)

Remember, you do not have to memorise this formula. It is very easy to derive any time you need
it. It is simply a matter of writing down what you have, deciding what you need, and solving for that
variable.

Example 1: Term of Investment - Logarithms



QUESTION


Suppose we invested R3 500 into a savings account which pays 7,5% compound interest. After
an unknown period of time our account is worth R4 044,69. For how long did we invest the
money? How does this compare with the trial and error answer from Chapter ??.


SOLUTION






Step 7 :


Determine what is given and what is required

â€¢ P = R3 500






â€¢ i = 7,5%








. A = R4 044,69
We are required to find n






Step 2 :


Determine how to approach the problem

We know that:






A =


P(l + i) n






(1 + 0" =


(A/P)






bg((l + i)") =


log(A/P)






nlog(l + i) =


log(A/P)






n =


log(A/P)/log(l + i)




Step 3 :


Solve the problem








n = log(A/P)/log(l + Â»)

logf 4044 ' 69 ) 7 5
= , , 3 â„¢ ' Remember that: 7.5% ='â€žâ€ž= 0.075
log(l + 0.075) 100

= 2.0




Step 4 :


Write final answer

The R3 500 was invested for 2


years.








4.3 Series of Payments




By this stage, you know how to do calculations such as 'If I want Rl 000 in three years' time, how
much do I need to invest now at 10%?'

What if we extend this as follows: "If I want to draw Rl 000 next year, Rl 000 the next year and Rl 000



10



CHAPTER 4. FINANCE 4.3



after three years, how much do I need to initially put into a bank account earning 10% p.a. to be able
to afford to be able to do this?"

The obvious way of working that out is to work out how much you need now to afford the pay-
ments individually and sum them. We'll work out how much is needed now to afford the payment of
Rl 000 in a year (= Rl 000 x (1,10) _1 =R909,09), the amount needed now for the following year's
Rl 000(=R1 000 x (1,10)~ 2 = R826,45) and the amount needed now for the Rl 000 after three years
(=R1 000 x (1,10)~ 3 =R751,31). Adding these together gives you the amount needed to afford all
three payments and you get R2 486,85.

So, if you put R2 486,85 into a 10% bank account now, you will be able to draw out Rl 000 in a year,
Rl 000 a year after that, and Rl 000 a year after that - and your bank account balance will decrease to
R0. You would have had exactly the right amount of money to do that (obviously!).

You can check this as follows:

Amount at Time (i.e. Now) = R2 486,85

Amount at Time 1 (i.e. a year later) = R2 486,85(1 + 10%) = R2 735,54

Amount after withdrawing Rl 000 = R2 735,54 - Rl 000 = Rl 735,54

Amount at Time 2 (i.e. a year later) = Rl 735,54(1 + 10%) = Rl 909,09

Amount after withdrawing Rl 000 = Rl 909,09 - Rl 000 = R909,09

Amount at Time 3 (i.e. a year later) = R909,09(l + 10%) = Rl 000

Amount after withdrawing Rl 000 = Rl 000 - Rl 000 = R0

Perfect! Of course, for only three years, that was not too bad. But what if I asked you how much you
needed to put into a bank account now, to be able to afford R100 a month for the next 1 5 years. If you
used the above approach you would still get the right answer, but it would take you weeks!

There is - I'm sure you guessed - an easier way! This section will focus on describing how to work
with:

â€¢ annuities - a fixed sum payable each year or each month, either to provide a pre-determined
sum at the end of a number of years or months (referred to as a future value annuity) or a fixed
amount paid each year or each month to repay (amortise) a loan (referred to as a present value
annuity).

â€¢ bond repayments - a fixed sum payable at regular intervals to pay off a loan. This is an example
of a present value annuity.

â€¢ sinking funds - an accounting term for cash set aside for a particular purpose and invested so that
the correct amount of money will be available when it is needed. This is an example of a future
value annuity.

Present Values of a Series of Payments W emcah



So having reviewed the mathematics of sequences and series, you might be wondering how this is
meant to have any practical purpose! Given that we are in the finance section, you would be right to
guess that there must be some financial use to all this. Here is an example which happens in many
people's lives - so you know you are learning something practical.

Let us say you would like to buy a property for R300 000, so you go to the bank to apply for a mortgage
bond. The bank wants it to be repaid by annually payments for the next 20 years, starting at end of
this year. They will charge you 15% interest per annum. At the end of the 20 years the bank would
have received back the total amount you borrowed together with all the interest they have earned from
lending you the money. You would obviously want to work out what the annual repayment is going to
be!

Let X be the annual repayment, i is the interest rate, and M is the amount of the mortgage bond you
will be taking out.

Time lines are particularly useful tools for visualising the series of payments for calculations, and we
can represent these payments on a time line as:



XX XXX

t t i â–  ' iii T c : h e Flows

12 18 19 20



Figure 4.1: Time line for an annuity (in arrears) of X for n periods.

The present value of all the payments (which includes interest) must equate to the (present) value of
the mortgage loan amount.

Mathematically, you can write this as:

M = X(l + i)- 1 + X(l + â‚¬)- 2 + X{1 + i)- 3 + â–  â–  â–  + X(l + i)- 20

The painful way of solving this problem would be to do the calculation for each of the terms above -
which is 20 different calculations. Not only would you probably get bored along the way, but you are
also likely to make a mistake.

Naturally, there is a simpler way of doing this! You can rewrite the above equation as follows:



M = Xlv 1 + v 2 + v 3 + h v 20 }

where v = (1 + Â«) _1 = 1/(1 + i)

Of course, you do not have to use the method of substitution to solve this. We just find this a useful
method because you can get rid of the negative exponents - which can be quite confusing! As an
exercise - to show you are a real financial whizz - try to solve this without substitution. It is actually
quite easy.

Now, the item in square brackets is the sum of a geometric sequence, as discussion in section 3. This



12



CHAPTER 4. FINANCE



4.3



can be re-written as follows, using what we know from Chapter 3 of this text book:

v(l + v + v + â€¢ â–  â–  + v n ~ )
' \-v n S
1 ~
l-v n
l/v- 1

l-(i + Q-

i



Note that we took out a common factor of v before using the formula for the geometric sequence.
So we can write:

M = X



(l-(l + i)-Â»)



This can be re-written:



X



M



Mi



(i-(i + Q-")l



(l + i)- n



So, this formula is useful if you know the amount of the mortgage bond you need and want to work
out the repayment, or if you know how big a repayment you can afford and want to see what property
you can buy.

For example, if I want to buy a house for R300 000 over 20 years, and the bank is going to charge me
15% per annum on the outstanding balance, then the annual repayment is:



.Y



Mi



1- (1 + i)""
R300 000x0,15

1-(1 + 0,15)- 20
R47 928.44



This means, each year for the next 20 years, I need to pay the bank R47 928,44 per year before I have
paid off the mortgage bond.

On the other hand, if I know I will have only R30 000 per year to repay my bond, then how big a house
can I buy? That is easy.



M



X



(i-(i + 0-)



R30 000



(1 - (1,15)- 20 )

R187 779,94



So, for R30 000 a year for 20 years, I can afford to buy a house of R187 800 (rounded to the nearest
hundred).

The bad news is that R187 800 does not come close to the R300 000 you wanted to pay! The good
news is that you do not have to memorise this formula. In fact , when you answer questions like this in
an exam, you will be expected to start from the beginning - writing out the opening equation in full,
showing that it is the sum of a geometric sequence, deriving the answer, and then coming up with the
correct numerical answer.

Example 2: Monthly mortgage repayments



QUESTION



Sam is looking to buy his first flat, and has R15 000 in cash savings which he will use as a
deposit. He has viewed a flat which is on the market for R250 000, and he would like to work
out how much the monthly repayments would be. He will be taking out a 30 year mortgage
with monthly repayments. The annual interest rate is 11%.



SOLUTION



Step 1 : Determine what is given and what is needed

â€¢ Deposit amount = R15 000

The following is given: â€¢ Price of flat = R250 000

â€¢ interest rate, i = 11%

We are required to find the monthly repayment for a 30-year mortgage.

Step 2 : Determine how to approach the problem

We know that:

X: M



(l-(l + i)-") l



In order to use this equation, we need to calculate M, the amount of the mortgage
bond, which is the purchase price of property less the deposit which Sam pays
upfront.

M = R250 000 - R15 000
= R235 000

Now because we are considering monthly repayments, but we have been
given an annual interest rate, we need to convert this to a monthly interest rate,
ji2. (If you are not clear on this, go back and revise Section ??.)



(i + ii 2 r


= (i + Â»)


(1 + J12) 12


= 1,11


ii2


= 0,873459%



We know that the mortgage bond is for 30 years, which equates to 360
months.

Step 3 : Solve the problem

Now it is easy, we can just plug the numbers in the formula, but do not forget
that you can always deduce the formula from first principles as well!



X



M



r (l-(l + i)-") i

R235 000

r (l-(1.00876459)- 360 ) i
I 0,008734594 J

R2 146,39



Step 4 : Write the final answer



li



CHAPTER 4. FINANCE 4.3



That means that to buy a flat for R250 000, after Sam pays a R15 000 deposit,
he will make repayments to the bank each month for the next 30 years equal to
R2 146,39.



Example 3: Monthly mortgage repayments



QUESTION



You are considering purchasing a flat for R200 000 and the bank's mortgage rate is currently
9% per annum payable monthly. You have savings of R10 000 which you intend to use for
a deposit. How much would your monthly mortgage payment be if you were considering a
mortgage over 20 years.



SOLUTION



Step 1 : Determine what is given and what is required

The following is given:

â€¢ Deposit amount = R10 000

â€¢ Price of flat = R200 000

â€¢ Interest rate, i = 9%

We are required to find the monthly repayment for a 20-year mortgage.

Step 2 : Determine how to approach the problem

We are considering monthly mortgage repayments, so it makes sense to use
months as our time period.

The interest rate was quoted as 9% per annum payable monthly, which
means that the monthly effective rate = 5J = 0,75% per month. Once we
have converted 20 years into 240 months, we are ready to do the calculations!

First we need to calculate M, the amount of the mortgage bond, which is
the purchase price of property minus the deposit which Sam pays up-front.

M = R200 000 - R10 000
= R190 000

The present value of our mortgage payments X (which includes interest),
must equate to the present mortgage amount

M = X x (H-0,75%) -1 +

X x (l + 0,75%r 2 +

X x (l + 0,75%r 3 +

X x (l + 0,75%r 4 + ...
X x (1 + 0,75%r 239 + X x (1 + 0,75%r 240

But it is clearly much easier to use our formula than work out 240 factors
and add them all up!

Step 3 : Solve the problem



15



4.3 CHAPTER 4. FINANCE



X x 111,14495 = R190 000
X = Rl 709,48



Step 4 : Write f/ie ffna/ answer

So to repay a R190 000 mortgage over 20 years, at 9% interest payable monthly,
will cost you Rl 709,48 per month for 240 months.



Show Me the Money

Now that you've done the calculations for the worked example and know what the monthly repayments
are, you can work out some surprising figures. For example, Rl 709,48 per month for 240 months
makes for a total of R410 275,20 (=R1 709,48 x 240). That is more than double the amount that you
borrowed! This seems like a lot. However, now that you've studied the effects of time (and interest) on
money, you should know that this amount is somewhat meaningless. The value of money is dependant
on its timing.

Nonetheless, you might not be particularly happy to sit back for 20 years making your Rl 709,48
mortgage payment every month knowing that half the money you are paying are going toward interest.
But there is a way to avoid those heavy interest charges. It can be done for less than R300 extra every
month.

So our payment is now R2 000. The interest rate is still 9% per annum payable monthly (0,75% per
month), and our principal amount borrowed is R190 000. Making this higher repayment amount every
month, how long will it take to pay off the mortgage?

The present value of the stream of payments must be equal to R190 000 (the present value of the
borrowed amount). So we need to solve for n in:



R2 000 x [1 - (1 + 0,75%r n ]/0,75% = R190 000

1- (1 + 0,75%)- = ( 19000 2 X 00 Â°' 75% )

lorfl + 0,75%)- = log[(l- 19000 2 Â° X 00 ' 0075 ]

, ,-, â€ž, r Â»,> , r/-, 190 000x0,0075,

-nxlog(l + 0,75%) = log[(l ^^ ]

-n x 0,007472 = -1,2465

n = 166,8 months

= 13,9 years



So the mortgage will be completely repaid in less than 14 years, and you would have made a total
payment of 166,8 x R2 000 = R333 600.

Can you see what is happened? Making regular payments of R2 000 instead of the required Rl 709,48,
you will have saved R76 675,20 (= R410 275,20- R333 600) in interest, and yet you have only paid
an additional amount of R290,52 for 1 66,8 months, or R48 458,74. You surely know by now that the
difference between the additional R48 458,74 that you have paid and the R76 675,20 interest that you
have saved is attributable to, yes, you have got it, compound interest!

CHAPTER 4. FINANCE 4.3



Future Value of a Series of Payments mEMCAi



In the same way that when we have a single payment, we can calculate a present value or a future
value - we can also do that when we have a series of payments.

In the above section, we had a few payments, and we wanted to know what they are worth now -
so we calculated present values. But the other possible situation is that we want to look at the future
value of a series of payments.

Maybe you want to save up for a car, which will cost R45 000 - and you would like to buy it in 2 years
time. You have a savings account which pays interest of 12% per annum. You need to work out how
much to put into your bank account now, and then again each month for 2 years, until you are ready
to buy the car.

Can you see the difference between this example and the ones at the start of the chapter where we
were only making a single payment into the bank account - whereas now we are making a series of
payments into the same account? This is a sinking fund.

So, using our usual notation, let us write out the answer. Make sure you agree how we come up with
this. Because we are making monthly payments, everything needs to be in months. So let A be the
closing balance you need to buy a car, P is how much you need to pay into the bank account each
month, and i r2 is the monthly interest rate. (Careful - because 12% is the annual interest rate, so we
will need to work out later what the monthly interest rate is!)

A = P(1 + in) 24 + P(l + Â«i2) 23 + â–  â–  â–  + P(l + J12) 1
Here are some important points to remember when deriving this formula:

1. We are calculating future values, so in this example we use (1 + ir 2 ) n and not (1 + 112)"".
Check back to the start of the chapter if this is not obvious to you by now.

2. If you draw a timeline you will see that the time between the first payment and when you buy
the car is 24 months, which is why we use 24 in the first exponent.

3. Again, looking at the timeline, you can see that the 24" 1 payment is being made one month
before you buy the car - which is why the last exponent is a 1.

4. Always check that you have got the right number of payments in the equation. Check right now
that you agree that there are 24 terms in the formula above.

So, now that we have the right starting point, let us simplify this equation:

A = P[(l + j 12 ) 24 + (l + i 12 ) 23 + ... + (l-H 12 ) 1 ]

= P[X 2A + X 23 + â– â– â–  + X 1 ] using X = (1 + i 12 )

Note that this time X has a positive exponent not a negative exponent, because we are doing future
values. This is not a rule you have to memorise - you can see from the equation what the obvious
choice of X should be.

Let us re-order the terms:

A = PIX 1 + X 2 H h X 24 ] = P . X[l + X + X 2 + h X 23 ]

This is just another sum of a geometric sequence, which as you know can be simplified as:

A = P.X[X n -l]/((l + i 12 )-l)
= P.X{X n -l]/i 12



4.4



CHAPTER 4. FINANCE



So if we want to use our numbers, we know that A =R45 000, n = 24 (because we are looking at
monthly payments, so there are 24 months involved) and i = 12% per annum.

BUT (and it is a big but) we need a monthly interest rate. Do not forget that the trick is to keep the time
periods and the interest rates in the same units - so if we have monthly payments, make sure you use a
monthly interest rate! Using the formula from Grade 1 1, we know that (1 +i) = (1 4- J12) 12 . So we
can show that i 12 = 0,0094888 = 0,94888%.

Therefore,

45 000 = P(l,0094888)[(l,0094888) 24 - l]/0,0094888
P = 1662,67



This means you need to invest R166 267 each month into that bank account to be able to pay for your
car in 2 years time.



Exercise 4-1



1 . You have taken out a mortgage bond for R875 000 to buy a flat. The bond is for 30 years and the
interest rate is 12% per annum payable monthly.

(a) What is the monthly repayment on the bond?

(b) How much interest will be paid in total over the 30 years?

2. How much money must be invested now to obtain regular annuity payments of R5 500 per
month for five years? The money is invested at 11,1% p. a., compounded monthly. (Answer to
the nearest hundred rand.)

4.4 Investments and Loans




By now, you should be well equipped to perform calculations with compound interest. This section
aims to allow you to use these valuable skills to critically analyse investment and loan options that you
will come across in your later life. This way, you will be able to make informed decisions on options
presented to you.

At this stage, you should understand the mathematical theory behind compound interest. However,
the numerical implications of compound interest are often subtle and far from obvious.

Recall the example 'Show Me the Money' in Section 4.3.2. For an extra payment of R29 052 a month,
we could have paid off our loan in less than 14 years instead of 20 years. This provides a good
illustration of the long term effect of compound interest that is often surprising. In the following
section, we'll aim to explain the reason for the drastic reduction in the time it takes to repay the loan.

CHAPTER 4. FINANCE 4.4



Loan Schedules â–  emcak



So far, we have been working out loan repayment amounts by taking all the payments and discounting
them back to the present time. We are not considering the repayments individually. Think about the
time you make a repayment to the bank. There are numerous questions that could be raised: how
much do you still owe them? Since you are paying off the loan, surely you must owe them less money,
but how much less? We know that we'll be paying interest on the money we still owe the bank. When
exactly do we pay interest? How much interest are we paying?

The answer to these questions lie in something called the load schedule.

We will continue to use the earlier example. There is a loan amount of R190 000. We are paying it
off over 20 years at an interest of 9% per annum payable monthly. We worked out that the repayments
should be Rl 709,48.

Consider the first payment of Rl 709,48 one month into the loan. First, we can work out how much
interest we owe the bank at this moment. We borrowed R190 000 a month ago, so we should owe:



M x iia

R190 000 x 0,75%

R1425



We are paying them Rl 425 in interest. We call this the interest component of the repayment. We are
only paying off Rl 709,48â€” Rl 425 =R284,48 of what we owe! This is called the capital component.
That means we still owe R190 000- R284,48 = R189 715,52. This is called the capital outstanding.
Let's see what happens at the end of the second month. The amount of interest we need to pay is the
interest on the capital outstanding.



M x ii2

R189 715,52 x 0,75%

Rl 422,87



Since we don't owe the bank as much as we did last time, we also owe a little less interest. The capital
component of the repayment is now Rl 709,48â€” Rl 422,87 = R286,61. The capital outstanding will
be R189 715,52- R286,61 = R189 428,91. This way, we can break each of our repayments down into
an interest part and the part that goes towards paying off the loan.

This is a simple and repetitive process. Table 4.1 is a table showing the breakdown of the first 12
payments. This is called a loan schedule.

Now, let's see the same thing again, but with R2 000 being repaid each year. We expect the numbers
to change. However, how much will they change by? As before, we owe Rl 425 in interest in interest.
After one month. However, we are paying R2 000 this time. That leaves R575 that goes towards paying
off the capital outstanding, reducing it to R189 425. By the end of the second month, the interest owed
is Rl 420,69 (That's R189 425 x i 12 ). Our R2 000 pays for that interest, and reduces the capital amount
owed by R2 000- Rl 420,69 = R579,31. This reduces the amount outstanding to R188 845,69.

Doing the same calculations as before yields a new loan schedule shown in Table 4.2.

The important numbers to notice is the "Capital Component" column. Note that when we are paying
off R2 000 a month as compared to Rl 709,48 a month, this column more than double. In the beginning
of paying off a loan, very little of our money is used to pay off the capital outstanding. Therefore, even

CHAPTER 4. FINANCE 4.4



a small increase in repayment amounts can significantly increase the speed at which we are paying off
the capital.

What's more, look at the amount we are still owing after one year (i.e. at time 12). When we were
paying Rl 709,48 a month, we still owe R186 441,84. However, if we increase the repayments to
R2 000 a month, the amount outstanding decreases by over R3 000 to R182 808,14. This means we
would have paid off over R7 000 in our first year instead of less than R4 000. This increased speed at
which we are paying off the capital portion of the loan is what allows us to pay off the whole loan
in around 14 years instead of the original 20. Note however, the effect of paying R2 000 instead of
Rl 709,48 is more significant in the beginning of the loan than near the end of the loan.

It is noted that in this instance, by paying slightly more than what the bank would ask you to pay, you
can pay off a loan a lot quicker. The natural question to ask here is: why are banks asking us to pay the
lower amount for much longer then? Are they trying to cheat us out of our money?

There is no simple answer to this. Banks provide a service to us in return for a fee, so they are out to
make a profit. However, they need to be careful not to cheat their customers for fear that they'll simply
use another bank. The central issue here is one of scale. For us, the changes involved appear big. We
are paying off our loan 6 years earlier by paying just a bit more a month. To a bank, however, it doesn't
matter much either way. In all likelihood, it doesn't affect their profit margins one bit!

Remember that the bank calculates repayment amounts using the same methods as we've been learn-
ing. They decide on the correct repayment amounts for a given interest rate and set of terms. Smaller
repayment amounts will make the bank more money, because it will take you longer to pay off the
loan and more interest will accumulate. Larger repayment amounts mean that you will pay off the loan
faster, so you will accumulate less interest i.e. the bank will make less money off of you. It's a simple
matter of less money now or more money later. Banks generally use a 20 year repayment period by
default.

Learning about financial mathematics enables you to duplicate these calculations for yourself. This
way, you can decide what's best for you. You can decide how much you want to repay each month
and you'll know of its effects. A bank wouldn't care much either way, so you should pick something
that suits you.



Example 4: Monthly Payments



QUESTION



Stefan and Mama want to buy a house that costs R 1 200 000. Their parents offer to put down
a 20% payment towards the cost of the house. They need to get a mortgage for the balance.
What are their monthly repayments if the term of the home loan is 30 years and the interest is
7,5%, compounded monthly?



SOLUTION



Step 1 : Determine how much money they need to borrow

Rl 200 00-R240 000 =R960 000

Step 2 : Determine how to approach the problem

Use the formula:

p _ x[l-(l + i)-"]



Where

P =R960 000

Calculating Capital Outstanding



EMCAL



As defined in Section 4.4.1, capital outstanding is the amount we still owe the people we borrowed
money from at a given moment in time. We also saw how we can calculate this using loan schedules.
However, there is a significant disadvantage to this method: it is very time consuming. For example, in
order to calculate how much capital is still outstanding at time 12 using the loan schedule, we'll have
to first calculate how much capital is outstanding at time 1 through to 11 as well. This is already quite
a bit more work than we'd like to do. Can you imagine calculating the amount outstanding after 10
years (time 120)?

Fortunately, there is an easier method. However, it is not immediately clear why this works, so let's
take some time to examine the concept.



Prospective Method for Capital Outstanding

Let's say that after a certain number of years, just after we made a repayment, we still owe amount Y.
What do we know about Yl We know that using the loan schedule, we can calculate what it equals
to, but that is a lot of repetitive work. We also know that Y is the amount that we are still going to pay



CHAPTER 4. FINANCE



4.5



off. In other words, all the repayments we are still going to make in the future will exactly pay off Y.
This is true because in the end, after all the repayments, we won't be owing anything.

Therefore, the present value of all outstanding future payments equal the present amount outstanding.
This is the prospective method for calculating capital outstanding.

Let's return to a previous example. Recall the case where we were trying to repay a loan of R200 000
over 20 years. A RIO 000 deposit was put down, so the amount being payed off was R190 000. At an
interest rate of 9% compounded monthly, the monthly repayment was Rl 709,48. In Table 4.1, we can
see that after 12 months, the amount outstanding was R186 441,84. Let's try to work this out using the
the prospective method.

After time 12, there are still 19 x 12 = 228 repayments left of Rl 709,48 each. The present value is:



228
0,75%



Y



Rl 709,48 x
R186 441,92



1 - 1,0075'
0,0075



Oops! This seems to be almost right, but not quite. We should have got R186 441,84. We are 8
cents out. However, this is in fact not a mistake. Remember that when we worked out the monthly
repayments, we rounded to the nearest cents and arrived at Rl 709,48. This was because one cannot
make a payment for a fraction of a cent. Therefore, the rounding off error was carried through. That's
why the two figures don't match exactly. In financial mathematics, this is largely unavoidable.

Factorising Cubic
Polynomials





5. 1 Introduction




In Grades 10 and 1 1, you learnt how to solve different types of equations. Most of the solutions, relied
on being able to factorise some expression and the factorisation of quadratics was studied in detail.
This chapter focuses on the factorisation of cubic polynomials, that is expressions with the highest
power equal to 3.

5.2 The Factor Theorem




The factor theorem describes the relationship between the root of a polynomial and a factor of the
polynomial.

QUESTION

Use the Factor Theorem to determine whether y â€” 1 is a factor of f(y) = 2y 4 + 3y 2 â€” by + 7.

SOLUTION



Step 1 : Determine how to approach the problem

In order for y â€” 1 to be a factor, /(l) must be 0.

Step 2 : Calculate /(l)



f(y) = 2y i + 3y 2 -by + 7

.-./(l) = 2(l) 4 + 3(l) 2 -5(l) + 7

= 2+3-5+7

= 7

Step 3 : Conclusion

Since /(l) ^ 0, y - 1 is not a factor of /(j/) = 2j/ 4 + 3j/ 2 - 5?/ + 7.

In order for y + 4 to be a factor, g(â€” 4) must be 0.

Step 2 : Calculate /(l)



g(y) = by" + 16j/ 3 - lby 2 + Sy + 16

Step 3 : Conclusion



5.3



CHAPTER 5. FACTORISING CUBIC POLYNOMIALS



Since ff(-4) = 0, y + 4 is a factor of g(y) = 5?/ 4 + 16y 3 - 15y 2 + 8j/ + 16.




5.3 Factorisation of Cubic
Polynomials




A cubic polynomial is a polynomial of the form

ax + fox + ex + d

where a is nonzero. We have seen in Grade 10 that the sum and difference of cubes is factorised as
follows:



(x + y)(x 2 -xy + y 2 ) = x 3 + y 3



and



(x - y)(x 2 + xy + y 2 ) = x 3 - y 3
We also saw that the quadratic factor does not have real roots.

There are many methods of factorising a cubic polynomial. The general method is similar to that used
to factorise quadratic equations. If you have a cubic polynomial of the form:

/(x) = ax + fox + ex + d

then in an ideal world you would get factors of the form:

(Ax + B)(Cx + D)(Ex + F). (5.1)

But sometimes you will get factors of the form:

{Ax + B)(Cx 2 +Ex + D)

We will deal with simplest case first. When a = 1, then A = C = E = 1, and you only have to
determine B, D and F. For example, find the factors of:



In this case we have

a = 1

fo = -2

c = -5

d = 6

The factors will have the general form shown in (5.1), with A = C = E = 1. We can then use values
for a, fo, c and d to determine values for B, D and F. We can re-write (5.1) with A = C = E = 1 as:



If we multiply this out we get:

{x + B)(x + D)(x + F)

We can therefore write:



(x + B){x + D){x + F).



(x + B)(x 2 + Dx + Fx + DF)



x 3 + Dx 2 + Fx 2 + Bx 2 + DFx + BDx + BFx + BDF
x 3 + (D + F + B)x 2 + {DF + BD + BF)x + BDF



fo =


-2 = D + F + B


c =


-5 = DF + BD + BF


d =


6 = BDF.



(5.2)
(5.3)
(5.4)



CHAPTER 5. FACTORISING CUBIC POLYNOMIALS 5.3



This is a set of three equations in three unknowns. However, we know that B, D and F are factors of
6 because BDF = 6. Therefore we can use a trial and error method to find B, D and F.
This can become a very tedious method, therefore the Factor Theorem can be used to find the factors
of cubic polynomials.



Example 3: Factorisation of Cubic Polynomials



QUESTION



Factorise f(x) = x 3 + x 2 â€” 9x â€” 9 into three linear factors.



SOLUTION



Step I : By trial and error using the factor theorem to find a factor

Try

/(l) = (l) 3 + (l) 2 - 9(1) -9 = 1 + 1-9-9 = -16

Therefore (x â€” 1) is not a factor
Try

/(-l) = (-1) 3 + (-1) 2 9(-1)9 = 1 + 1 + 99 =

Thus (x + 1) is a factor, because /(â€” 1) = 0.

Now divide f(x) by (x + 1) using division by inspection:
Write x 3 + x 2 -9x-9 = (x + 1)( )

The first term in the second bracket must be a; 2 to give x 3 if one works backwards.
The last term in the second bracket must be â€”9 because +1 x â€” 9 = â€”9.
So we have x 3 + x 2 - 9x - 9 = (x + l)(x 2 +?x - 9).
Now, we must find the coefficient of the middle term (x).

(+l)(x 2 ) gives the x 2 in the original polynomial. So, the coefficient of the x-term
must be 0.
So/(x) = (x + l)(x 2 -9).



Step 2 : Factorise fully

x 2 â€” 9 can be further factorised to (x â€” 3)(x + 3),
and we are now left with /(x) = (x + l)(x â€” 3)(x + 3)



In general, to factorise a cubic polynomial, you find one factor by trial and error. Use the factor theorem
to confirm that the guess is a root. Then divide the cubic polynomial by the factor to obtain a quadratic.
Once you have the quadratic, you can apply the standard methods to factorise the quadratic.

For example the factors of x 3 â€” 2x 2 â€” 5x + 6 can be found as follows: There are three factors which
we can write as

(x â€” a)(x â€” b)(x â€” c).



5.3 CHAPTER 5. FACTORISING CUBIC POLYNOMIALS



Example 4: Factorisation of Cubic Polynomials



QUESTION



Use the Factor Theorem to factorise



SOLUTION



Step 1 : Find one factor using the Factor Theorem

Try

/(l) = (l) 3 - 2(1) 2 - 5(1) + 6 = 1-2-5 + 6 =
Therefore (x â€” 1) is a factor.

Step 2 : Division by inspection

x 3 -2x 2 -5x + 6 = (x- 1)( )

The first term in the second bracket must be x 2 to give x 3 if one works backwards.
The last term in the second bracket must be â€”6 because â€” 1 x â€” 6 = +6.
So we have x 3 - 2x 2 - 5x + 6 = (x - l)(x 2 +?x - 6).
Now, we must find the coefficient of the middle term (x).
(â€” l)(x 2 ) gives â€”x 2 . So, the coefficient of the x-term must be â€”1.
So/(x) = (x- \){x 2 -x-6).

Step 3 : Factorise fully

x 2 â€” x â€” 6 can be further factorised to (x â€” 3)(x + 2),
and we are now left with x 3 â€” 2x 2 â€” bx + 6 = (x â€” l)(x â€” 3)(x + 2)

/(-2) = (-2) 3 - 2(-2) 2 - 6(-2) + 4 = -8 -8 + 12 + 4 =
Therefore (x + 2) IS a factor.

Step 2 : Division by inspection

x 3 -2x 2 -6x + 4 = (x + 2)( )

The first term in the second bracket must be x 2 to give x 3 .
The last term in the second bracket must be 2 because 2x2 = +4.
So we have x 3 - 2x 2 - 6x + 4 = (x + 2)(x 2 +?x + 2).
Now, we must find the coefficient of the middle term (x).

6.2 Definition of a Function



A function is a relation for which there is only one value of y corresponding to any value of x. We
sometimes write y = fix), which is notation meaning 'y is a function of x'. This definition makes
complete sense when compared to our real world examples â€” each person has only one height, so
height is a function of people; on each day, in a specific town, there is only one average temperature.

However, some very common mathematical constructions are not functions. For example, consider the
relation x 2 + y 2 = 4. This relation describes a circle of radius 2 centred at the origin, as in Figure 6.1 .



If we let x = 0, we see that y 2 = 4 and thus either y
which are possible for the same x value, the relation x 2



2 or y = â€”2. Since there are two y values
- y 2 = 4 is not the graph a function.



There is a simple test to check if a relation is a function, by looking at its graph. This test is called the
vertical line test. If it is possible to draw any vertical line (a line of constant x) which crosses the graph
of the relation more than once, then the relation is not a function. If more than one intersection point
exists, then the intersections correspond to multiple values of y lor a single value of x.

We can see this with our previous example of the circle by looking at its graph again in Figure 6.1.

We see that we can draw a vertical line, for example the dotted line in the drawing, which cuts the
circle more than once. Therefore this is not a function.

6.3 Notation Used for Functions




In Grade 1 you were introduced to the notation used to name a function. In a function y = f(x), y is
called the dependent variable, because the value of y depends on what you choose as x. We say x is
the independent variable, since we can choose x to be any number. Similarly if g(t) = 2t + 1, then t
is the independent variable and g is the function name. If f(x) = 3x â€” 5 and you are ask to determine
/(3), then you have to work out the value for f(x) when x = 3. For example,

6.4 Graphs of Inverse Functions



In earlier grades, you studied various types of functions and understood the effect of various parameters
in the general equation. In this section, we will consider inverse functions.

An inverse function is a function which does the reverse of a given function. More formally, if / is a
function with domain X, then / _1 is its inverse function if and only if for every ielwe have:

r 1 u(x)) = x (6.D

A simple way to think about this is that a function, say y = f(x), gives you a y-value if you substitute an
i-value into f(x). The inverse function tells you tells you which x-value was used to get a particular
j/-value when you substitute the y-value into f~ 1 (y). There are some things which can complicate
this - for example, for the sin function there are many x-values that give you a peak as the function
oscillates. This means that the inverse of the sin function would be tricky to define because if you
substitute the peak j/-value into it you won't know which of the i-values was used to get the peak.



y = f(x) we have a function
g/i = f{xi) we substitute a specific x-value into the function to get a specific j/-value

consider the inverse function
x = f' 1 {y)
x = f~ (y) substituting the specific y-value into the inverse should return the specific rc-value

= F\yi)

= X!

This works both ways, if we don't have any complications like in the case of the sin function, so we
can write:

r 1 (f(x)) = f(r 1 (x)) = x (6.2)

(x - 2)
For example, if the function x â€” > 3x + 2 is given, then its inverse function is x â€” > - â€” - â€” -. This is

usually written as:

/ : x^3x + 2 (6.3)

r 1 â–  Â»-^ (6.4)

The superscript " â€” 1" is not an exponent.

If a function / has an inverse then / is said to be invertible.

If / is a real-valued function, then for / to have a valid inverse, it must pass the horizontal line test,
that is a horizontal line y = k placed anywhere on the graph of / must pass through / exactly once
for all real k.

It is possible to work around this condition, by defining a multi-valued function as an inverse.

If one represents the function / graphically in a zy-coordinate system, the inverse function of the
equation of a straight line, f 1 , is the reflection of the graph of / across the line y = x.

Algebraically, one computes the inverse function of / by solving the equation

y = f(x)

for x, and then exchanging y and x to get

y = /^M

For example, the straight line equation given by y = 2x â€” 3 has as inverse the function, y â€” |x + Â§.
The graphs of these functions are shown in Figure 6.2. It can be seen that the two graphs are reflections

Domain and Range

We have seen that the domain of a function of the form y = ax + q is {x : x e M} and the range is
{y : y 6 M}. Since the inverse function of a straight line is also a straight line, the inverse function will
have the same domain and range as the original function.

Differential Calculus





7.1 Introduction




Calculus is one of the central branches of mathematics and was developed from algebra and geometry.
Calculus is built on the concept of limits, which will be discussed in this chapter. Calculus consists
of two complementary ideas: differential calculus and integral calculus. We will only be dealing with
differential calculus in this text and will explore how it can be used to address mathematical problems
like optimisation and finding rates of change.

The Tale of Achilles and the Tortoise



EMCBC



One of Zeno's paradoxes can be summarised as:



Achilles and a tortoise agree to a race, but the tortoise is unhappy because Achilles is very
fast. So, the tortoise asks Achilles for a head-start. Achilles agrees to give the tortoise a
1000m head start. Does Achilles overtake the tortoise?



We know how to solve this problem. We start by writing:

xa = 11 At (7.1)

x t = 1000m + v t t (7.2)



FACT



Zeno (circa 490 BC -
circa 430 BC) was a pre-
Socratic Greek philoso-
pher of southern Italy
who is famous for his
paradoxes.

xa distance covered by Achilles

overtakes the tortoise at a time calculated as:

This means that Achilles

= 571^s (7.11)

However, Zeno (the Greek philosopher who thought up this problem) looked at it as follows: Achilles

takes

1000 m

t = r = 500 s

2m â–  s -1

to travel the 1 000 m head start that the tortoise had. However, in these 500 s, the tortoise has travelled

a further

x = (500s)(0,25ms _1 ) = 125 m.

Achilles then takes another

125 m

t = ~ r = 62 ' 5s

2 m -s- 1

to travel the 125 m. In these 62,5 s, the tortoise travels a further

x = (62,5s)(0,25m-s _1 ) = 15,625 m.
Zeno saw that Achilles would always get closer but wouldn't actually overtake the tortoise.



Sequences, Series and Functions m emcbd



So what does Zeno, Achilles and the tortoise have to do with calculus?
Well, in Grades 10 and 1 1 you studied sequences. For the sequence

o-i- 2 - 3 - 4 -

'2'3'4'5'

which is defined by the expression

On = 1

n
the terms get closer to 1 as n gets larger. Similarly, for the sequence

' 2'3'4' 5'

which is defined by the expression

1

On = â€”

11

the terms get closer to as n gets larger. We have also seen that the infinite geometric series can have
a finite total. The infinite geometric series is



Soo = > Oi.r 1 = for â€” 1 < r < 1



l: 1



76



CHAPTER 7. DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS



7.2



where a\ is the first term of the series and r is the common ratio.

We see that there are some functions where the value of the function gets close to or approaches a
certain value.

Similarly, for the function:

x 2 + 4x - 12



x + 6



The numerator of the function can be factorised as:



Qr + 6)(x-2)
x + 6



Then we can cancel the x + 6 from numerator and denominator and we are left with:



However, we are only able to cancel the x + 6 term if x =Â£ â€”6. If x = â€”6, then the denominator
becomes and the function is not defined. This means that the domain of the function does not
include x = â€”6. But we can examine what happens to the values for y as x gets closer to â€”6. These
values are listed in Table 7.1 which shows that as x gets closer to â€”6, y gets close to 8.

Average Gradient and Gradient at a Point W emcbf



In Grade 10 you learnt about average gradients on a curve. The average gradient between any two
points on a curve is given by the gradient of the straight line that passes through both points. In Grade
1 1 you were introduced to the idea of a gradient at a single point on a curve. We saw that this was
the gradient of the tangent to the curve at the given point, but we did not learn how to determine the
gradient of the tangent.

Now let us consider the problem of trying to find the gradient of a tangent t to a curve with equation
y = /(x) at a given point P.




82



CHAPTER 7. DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS



7.2



We know how to calculate the average gradient between two points on a curve, but we need two
points. The problem now is that we only have one point, namely P. To get around the problem we
first consider a secant to the curve that passes through point P and another point on the curve Q,
where Q is an arbitrary distance (h) from P, as shown in the figure. We can now find the average
gradient of the curve between points P and Q.



f(a + h)
f(a)




secant



If the x-coordinate of P is a + h, then the ^-coordinate is /(a + h). Similarly, if the z-coordinate of Q
is a, then the ^-coordinate is f(a). If we choose a + h as x-i and a as xi, then:

2A = /0)
y-i = f(a + h).
We can now calculate the average gradient as:

2/2-2/1 f(a + h) - f(a)



(a + h) â€” a

f(a + h)-f(a)

h



(7.12)

(7.13)



Now imagine that Q moves along the curve toward P. The secant line approaches the tangent line as
its limiting position. This means that the average gradient of the secant approaches the gradient of the
tangent to the curve at P. In (??) we see that as point Q approaches point P, h gets closer to 0. When
h = 0, points P and Q are equal. We can now use our knowledge of limits to write this as:



gradient at P = lim

h->0



f(g + h)-f(h)
h



(7.14)



and we say that the gradient at point P is the limit of the average gradient as Q approaches P along
the curve.

For the function f(x) = 2x 2 â€” 5x, determine the gradient of the tangent to the curve at the

SOLUTION



Step 1 : Calculating the gradient at a point

We know that the gradient at a point x is given by:

lim f{x + k) - f{x)

In our case x = 2. It is simpler to substitute x = 2 at the end of the calculation.
Step 2 : Write f(x + h) and simplify

f(x + h) = 2{x + h) 2 -5(x + h)

= 2(x 2 + 2xh + h 2 ) - 5x - 5h
= 2x 2 + 4xh + 2h 2 -5x-5h

Step 5 : Write the final answer

The gradient of the tangent to the curve f(x) = 2x 2 â€” 5x at x = 2 is 3. This is
also the gradient of the curve at x = 2.

SOLUTION



Step 1 : Calculating the gradient at a point

We know that the gradient at a point x is given by:

In our case x = a. It is simpler to substitute x = a at the end of the calculation.
Step 2 : Write f(x + ft) and simplify

f(x + h) = 5(x + hf - A(x + ft) + 1

= 5(x 2 + 2xft + ft 2 ) -4x-4ft + l

7.3 Differentiation from First
Principles




The tangent problem has given rise to the branch of calculus called differential calculus and the
equation:

Um f(x + h)- f(x)
fc-MJ h

defines the derivative of the function f(x). Using (7.15) to calculate the derivative is called finding
the derivative from first principles.

DEFINITION: Derivative
The derivative of a function f(x) is written as f'(x) and is defined by:

f{x) = lim lk+K >-/w



(7.15)



There are a few different notations used to refer to derivatives. If we use the traditional notation
y = f{x) to indicate that the dependent variable is y and the independent variable is x, then some
common alternative notations for the derivative are as follows:



/'(*)



.'/



dy _ df_
dx dx



dx



f{x) = Df(x) = D x f(x)



The symbols D and 4- are called differential operators because they indicate the operation of differ-
entiation, which is the process of calculating a derivative. It is very important that you learn to identify
these different ways of denoting the derivative, and that you are consistent in your usage of them when
answering questions.

7.4 Rules of Differentiation




Calculating the derivative of a function from first principles is very long, and it is easy to make mistakes.
Fortunately, there are rules which make calculating the derivative simple.

Rules of Differentiation



From first principles, determine the derivatives of the following:

1. f(x) = b

2. f(x) = x

3. f(x) = x 2

4. f(x) = x 3

5. f(x) = l/x

You should have found the following:

If we examine these results we see that there is a pattern, which can be summarised by:

(7.16)



There are two other rules which make differentiation simpler. For any two functions f(x) and g(x):

d



dx



lf(x)Â±g(x)} = f'(x)Â±g'(x)



This means that we differentiate each term separately.

The final rule applies to a function f(x) that is multiplied by a constant k.

7.5 Applying Differentiation to
Draw Graphs



EMCB]



Thus far we have learnt about how to differentiate various functions, but I am sure that you are be-
ginning to ask, What is the point of learning about derivatives? Well, we know one important fact
about a derivative: it is a gradient. So, any problems involving the calculations of gradients or rates of
change can use derivatives. One simple application is to draw graphs of functions by firstly determine
the gradients of straight lines and secondly to determine the turning points of the graph.



Finding Equations of Tangents to Curves



EMCBK



In Section 7.2.4 we saw that finding the gradient of a tangent to a curve is the same as finding the
gradient (or slope) of the same curve at the point of the tangent. We also saw that the gradient of a
function at a point is just its derivative.

Since we have the gradient of the tangent and the point on the curve through which the tangent passes,
we can find the equation of the tangent.

Example 9: Finding the Equation of a Tangent to a Curve




QUESTION





Find the equation of the tangent to the curve y = x 2 at the point (1; 1) and draw both
functions.



SOLUTION



Step 1 : Determine what is required

We are required to determine the equation of the tangent to the curve defined
by y = x 2 at the point (1; 1). The tangent is a straight line and we can find the
equation by using derivatives to find the gradient of the straight line. Then we
will have the gradient and one point on the line, so we can find the equation
using:

y â€” j/i = m(x â€” xi)

from Grade 1 1 Coordinate Geometry.

Step 2 : Differentiate the function

Using our rules of differentiation we get:

y = 2x

Step 3 : Find the gradient at the point (1; 1)

In order to determine the gradient at the point (1: 1), we substitute the x-value
into the equation for the derivative. So, y' at x = 1 is:

m = 2(1) = 2
Step 4 : Find the equation of the tangent

If X

This

g point.





Differentiation can be used to sketch the graphs of functions, by helping determine the turning points.
We know that if a graph is increasing on an interval and reaches a turning point, then the graph will
start decreasing after the turning point. The turning point is also known as a stationary point because
the gradient at a turning point is 0. We can then use this information to calculate turning points, by
calculating the points at which the derivative of a function is 0.

Take the graph of y = x 2 as an example. We know that the graph of this function has a turning point
at (0,0), but we can use the derivative of the function:

y = 2x

and set it equal to to find the z-value for which the graph has a turning point.

2x =

x =

We then substitute this into the equation of the graph (i.e. y = x 2 ) to determine the ^-coordinate of
the turning point:

/(0) = (0) 2 =

This corresponds to the point that we have previously calculated.

CHAPTER 7. DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 7.5



Example 10: Calculation of Turning Points



QUESTION



Calculate the turning points of the graph of the function



f(x) = 2x 3 - 9x 2 + 12x - 15



SOLUTION



Step I : Determine the derivative of f(x)

Using the rules of differentiation we get:

f'(x) = fix 2 - 18x+ 12
Step 2 : Set f'(x) = and calculate x-coordinate of turning point



6x - 18x + 12


=





x 2 - 3x + 2


=





(x-2)(x-l)


=






Therefore, the turning points are at x = 2 and x = 1.
Step 3 : Substitute x-coordinate of turning point into f(x) to determine y-coordinates

/(2) = 2(2) 3 -9(2) 2 + 12(2) -15
= 16-36 + 24-15
= -11.



/(I) = 2(1) J -9(1) 2 + 12(1)-15
= 2-9 + 12-15
= -10

Step 4 : Write final answer

The turning points of the graph of /(x) = 2x 3 â€” 9x 2 + 12x â€” 15 are (2; â€”11)
and (1;-10).



We are now ready to sketch graphs of functions.

Method:

Sketching Graphs: Suppose we are given that f(x) = ax 3 + bx 2 + ex + d, then there are five steps to
be followed to sketch the graph of the function:



1 . Determine the value of the ?/-intercept by substituting x = into f(x)



93



7.5 CHAPTER 7. DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS



2. Determine the x-intercepts by factorising ax 3 + bx 2 + ex + d = and solving for x. First try
to eliminate constant common factors, and to group like terms together so that the expression is
expressed as economically as possible. Use the factor theorem if necessary.

3. Find the turning points of the function by working out the derivative ^ and setting it to zero,
and solving for x.

4. Determine the j/-coordinates of the turning points by substituting the x values obtained in the
previous step, into the expression for f(x).

5. Use the information you're given to plot the points and get a rough idea of the gradients between
points. Then fill in the missing parts of the function in a smooth, continuous curve.



Example 11: Sketching Graphs



QUESTION



Draw the graph of g(x) = x 2 â€” x + 2



SOLUTION



Step 7 : Determine the shape of the graph

The leading coefficient of x is > therefore the graph is a parabola with a
minimum.

5tep 2 : Determine the y-intercept

The ^-intercept is obtained by setting x = 0.

9 (0) = (0) 2 -0 + 2 = 2
The turning point is at (0: 2).

Step 3 : Determine the x-intercepts

The x-intercepts are found by setting g{x) = 0.

g(x) = x â€” x + 2
= x 2 - x + 2

Using the quadratic formula and looking at b 2 â€” iac we can see that this would
be negative and so this function does not have real roots. Therefore, the graph of
g(x) does not have any x-intercepts.

Step 4 : Find the turning points of the function

Work out the derivative ^ and set it to zero to for the x coordinate of the turning
point.

Step 1 : Determine the shape of the graph

The leading coefficient of x is < therefore the graph is a parabola with a

7.5 CHAPTER 7. DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS



Step 2 : Determine the y-intercept

We find the y-intercepts by finding the value for 9(0).

g(x) = â€” x + 6x â€” 9x + 4
y int = g(0) = -(0) 3 +6(0) 2 -9(0)+4
= 4

Step 3 : Determine the x-intercepts

We find the x-intercepts by finding the points for which the function g(x) = 0.

g(x) = â€”x + 6x â€” 9x + 4

Use the factor theorem to confirm that (x â€” 1) is a factor. If g(l) = 0, then
(x â€” 1) is a factor.

g(x) = â€”x + 6x â€” 9x + 4

9(1) = -(l) 3 +6(l) 2 -9(l) + 4

= -1 + 6-9 + 4

=

Therefore, (x â€” 1) is a factor.

If we divide g(x) by (x â€” 1) we are left with:

â€”x + 5x â€” 4

This has factors

-(x-4)(x- 1)

Therefore:

9 (x) = -(x-l)(x-l)(x-4)
The x-intercepts are: x int = 1; 4

Step 4 : Calculate the turning points

Find the turning points by setting g'(x) = 0.
If we use the rules of differentiation we get

g'(x) = -3x 2 + 12x-9

g'(x) =

-3x 2 + 12x - 9 =

x 2 - 4x + 3 =

(x-3)(x-l) =

The ^/-coordinates of the turning points are calculated as:

Therefore the turning points are: (1; 0) and (3; 4).

Local Minimum, Local Maximum and Point
of Inflection



EMCBM



If the derivative (J 2 ) is zero at a point, the gradient of the tangent at that point is zero. It means that a
turning point occurs as seen in the previous example.




From the drawing the point (1; 0) represents a local minimum and the point (3; 4) the local maximum.

A graph has a horizontal point of inflexion where the derivative is zero but the sign of the gradient
does not change. That means the graph will continue to increase or decrease after the stationary point.



MS



CHAPTER 7. DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS



7.6




From this drawing, the point (3; 1) is a horizontal point of inflexion, because the sign of the derivative
does not change from positive to negative.




7.6 Using Differential Calculus to
Solve Problems



We have seen that differential calculus can be used to determine the stationary points of functions, in
order to sketch their graphs. However, determining stationary points also lends itself to the solution of
problems that require some variable to be optimised.

For example, if fuel used by a car is defined by:



^-v 2 -6v + 245

oU



(7.19)



where v is the travelling speed, what is the most economical speed (that means the speed that uses the
least fuel)?

If we draw the graph of this function we find that the graph has a minimum. The speed at the minimum
would then give the most economical speed.

7.6 CHAPTER 7. DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS



We have seen that the coordinates of the turning point can be calculated by differentiating the function
and finding the x-coordinate (speed in the case of the example) for which the derivative is 0.

Differentiating (7.19), we get:

f'(v) = -v-6

If we set f'(v) = we can calculate the speed that corresponds to the turning point.



Â° = l V - 6
6 x 40

V = -3~
= 80



This means that the most economical speed is 80 km/h.

that corresponds to largest possible area that Michael can fence off.

SOLUTION



Step I : Examine the problem and formulate the equations that are required

The important pieces of information given are related to the area and modified
perimeter of the garden. We know that the area of the garden is:



.1



(7.24)



We are also told that the fence covers only 3 sides and the three sides should add
up to 160 m. This can be written as:



160 m = w + 1 + 1



(7.25)



101



7.6 CHAPTER 7. DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS

However, we can use (7.25) to write w in terms of /:

w = 160m -21 (7.26)

Substitute (7.26) into (7.24) to get:

A = (160 m - 21)1 = 160 m - 21 2 (7.27)

Step 2 : Differentiate

Since we are interested in maximising the area, we differentiate (7.27) to get:

A' (I) = 160 m -41

Step 3 : Find the stationary point

To find the stationary point, we set A'(l) = and solve for the value of I that
maximises the area.

A' (I) = 160 m -41

= 160m -41

:Al = 160m
160 m



4
I = 40 m

Substitute into (7.26) to solve for the width.

w = 160 m -21

= 160 m- 2(40 m)

= 160 m -80 m

= 80 m

Step 4 : Write the final answer

A width of 80 m and a length of 40 m will yield the maximal area fenced off.

Rate of Change Problems

When we mention rate of change, the latter is implied. Instan-

7.6 CHAPTER 7. DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS



taneous rate of change is the derivative. When average rate of change is required, it will be specifically
referred to as average rate of change.

Velocity is one of the most common forms of rate of change. Again, average velocity = average rate
of change and instantaneous velocity = instantaneous rate of change = derivative. Velocity refers to
the increase of distance(s) for a corresponding increase in time (t). The notation commonly used for
this is:

v(t) = J = ,'(*)

where s'(t) is the position function. Acceleration is the change in velocity for a corresponding increase
in time. Therefore, acceleration is the derivative of velocity

a(t) = v'(t)

This implies that acceleration is the second derivative of the distance(s).

The ball hits the ground after 4s. The velocity after 4s will be:

1,(4) = h'{A)

= 20 - 10(4)
= -20 m-s -1



The ball hits the ground at a speed of 20 m â–  s _1 . Notice that the sign of the
velocity is negative which means that the ball is moving downward (the reverse
of upward, which is when the velocity is positive).



Step 5 : Acceleration



a = v (t)

= â€”10 m â–  s~

Just because gravity is constant does not mean we should necessarily think of
acceleration as a constant. We should still consider it a function.

Linear Programming





8. 1 Introduction




In Grade 11 you were introduced to linear programming and solved problems by looking at points
on the edges of the feasible region. In Grade 12 you will look at how to solve linear programming
problems in a more general manner.

8.2 Terminology




Feasible Region and Points



EMCBR



Tip



The constraints are used
to create bounds of the
solution.



Tip



ax + by = c

o If b ^ 0, feasible
points must lie on the






o If b = 0, feasible
points must lie on the
line x = c/a

ax + by < c

o If b jL 0, feasible
points must lie on
or below the line

o If b = 0, feasible
points must lie on or
to the left of the line
x = c/a.



Constraints mean that we cannot just take any x and y when looking for the x and y that optimise our
objective function. If we think of the variables x and y as a point (x; y) in the xj/-plane then we call
the set of all points in the xj/-plane that satisfy our constraints the feasible region. Any point in the
feasible region is called a feasible point.



For example, the constraints



x >
y>0



mean that every (x,y) we can consider must lie in the first quadrant of the xy plane. The constraint

x>y
means that every (x,y) must lie on or below the line y = x and the constraint

x < 20

means that x must lie on or to the left of the line x = 20.

We can use these constraints to draw the feasible region as shown by the shaded region in Figure 8.1 .

When a constraint is linear, it means that it requires that any feasible point (x,y) lies on one side of
or on a line. Interpreting constraints as graphs in the xy plane is very important since it allows us to
construct the feasible region such as in Figure 8.1.

8.3 Linear Programming and the
Feasible Region




If the objective function and all of the constraints are linear then we call the problem of optimising
the objective function subject to these constraints a linear program. All optimisation problems we will
look at will be linear programs.

The major consequence of the constraints being linear is that the feasible region is always a polygon.
This is evident since the constraints that define the feasible region all contribute a line segment to its
boundary (see Figure 8.1). It is also always true that the feasible region is a convex polygon.

The objective function being linear means that the feasible point(s) that gives the solution of a linear
program always lies on one of the vertices of the feasible region. This is very important since, as we
will soon see, it gives us a way of solving linear programs.

We will now see why the solutions of a linear program always lie on the boundary of the feasible
region. Firstly, note that if we think of f(x,y) as lying on the z axis, then the function f(x,y) = ax + by
(where a and b are real numbers) is the definition of a plane. If we solve for y in the equation defining
the objective function then



f(x,y)



ax + by

f(x,y)



(8.1)



What this means is that if we find all the points where f(x,y) = c for any real number c (i.e. f(x,y)
is constant with a value of c), then we have the equation of a line. This line we call a level line of the
objective function.

Consider again the feasible region described in Figure 8.1. Let's say that we have the objective function
f(x,y) = x â€” 2y with this feasible region. If we consider Equation 8.3 corresponding to



then we get the level line



f(x,y) = -20

have also been drawn in. It is very important to realise that these are not the only level lines; in fact,
there are infinitely many of them and they are all parallel to each other. Remember that if we look at
any one level line f(x,y) has the same value for every point (x,y) that lies on that line. Also, f(x,y)
will always have different values on different level lines.




10 AS



Figure 8.2: The feasible region corresponding to the constraints x > 0, y > 0, x > y and x < 20 with
objective function f(x,y) = x â€” 2y, The dashed lines represent various level lines of f(x,y).



If a ruler is placed on the level line corresponding to f(x,y) = â€”20 in Figure 8.2 and moved down the
page parallel to this line then it is clear that the ruler will be moving over level lines which correspond
to larger values of f(x,y). So if we wanted to maximise f(x,y) then we simply move the ruler down the
page until we reach the bottom-most point in the feasible region. This point will then be the feasible
point that maximises f(x,y). Similarly, if we wanted to minimise f(x,y) then the top-most feasible
point will give the minimum value of f(x,y).

Since our feasible region is a polygon, these points will always lie on vertices in the feasible region.
The fact that the value of our objective function along the line of the ruler increases as we move it
down and decreases as we move it up depends on this particular example. Some other examples
might have that the function increases as we move the ruler up and decreases as we move it down.

It is a general property, though, of linear objective functions that they will consistently increase or
decrease as we move the ruler up or down. Knowing which direction to move the ruler in order to
maximise/minimise f(x,y) = ax + by is as simple as looking at the sign of 6 (i.e. "is b negative, positive
or zero?"). If b is positive, then f(x,y) increases as we move the ruler up and f(x,y) decreases as we
move the ruler down. The opposite happens for the case when b is negative: f(x,y) decreases as we
move the ruler up and f(x,y) increases as we move the ruler down. If b = 0, we need to look at the
sign of a.

If a is positive then f(x,y) increases as we move the ruler to the right and decreases if we move the
ruler to the left. Once again, the opposite happens for a negative. If we look again at the objective
function mentioned earlier,

f(x,y) = x - 2y

with a = 1 and b = â€”2, then we should find that f(x,y) increases as we move the ruler down the
page since b = â€” 2 < 0. This is exactly what happened in Figure 8.2.

The main points about linear programming we have encountered so far are



110



CHAPTER 8. LINEAR PROGRAMMING 8.3



â€¢ The feasible region is always a polygon.

â€¢ Solutions occur at vertices of the feasible region.

â€¢ Moving a ruler parallel to the level lines of the objective function up/down to the top/bottom of
the feasible region shows us which of the vertices is the solution.

â€¢ The direction in which to move the ruler is determined by the sign of b and also possibly by the
sign of a.

These points are sufficient to determine a method for solving any linear program.

Method: Linear Programming

If we wish to maximise the objective function f(x,y) then:

1 . Find the gradient of the level lines of f(x,y) (this is always going to be â€” | as we saw in Equa-
tion ??)

2. Place your ruler on the xy plane, making a line with gradient â€” | (i.e. b units on the x-axis and
â€”a units on the y-axis)

3. The solution of the linear program is given by appropriately moving the ruler. Firstly we need to
check whether b is negative, positive or zero.

(a) If b > 0, move the ruler up the page, keeping the ruler parallel to the level lines all the time,
until it touches the "highest" point in the feasible region. This point is then the solution.

(b) If b < 0, move the ruler in the opposite direction to get the solution at the "lowest" point in
the feasible region.

(c) If b = 0, check the sign of a

i. If a < move the ruler to the "leftmost" feasible point. This point is then the solution,
ii. If a > move the ruler to the "rightmost" feasible point. This point is then the solution.



Example 1: Prizes!



QUESTION

As part of their opening specials, a furniture store promised to give away at least 40 prizes
with a total value of at least R2 000. The prizes are kettles and toasters.

1 . If the company decides that there will be at least 10 of each prize, write down two more
inequalities from these constraints.

2. If the cost of manufacturing a kettle is R60 and a toaster is R50, write down an objective
function C which can be used to determine the cost to the company of both kettles and
toasters.

3. Sketch the graph of the feasibility region that can be used to determine all the possible
combinations of kettles and toasters that honour the promises of the company.

4. How many of each prize will represent the cheapest option for the company?

5. How much will this combination of kettles and toasters cost?



SOLUTION

CHAPTER 8. LINEAR PROGRAMMING



Step 1 : Identify the decision variables

Let the number of kettles be x and the number of toasters be y and write down
two constraints apart from x > and y > that must be adhered to.

Step 2 : Write constraint equations

Since there will be at least 10 of each prize we can write:



x > 10



and



y> 10
Also, the store promised to give away at least 40 prizes in total. Therefore:

x + y > 40

Step 3 : Write the objective function

The cost of manufacturing a kettle is R60 and a toaster is R50. Therefore the cost
the total cost C is:

C = 60x + 50j/

Step 5 : Determine vertices of feasible region

From the graph, the coordinates of vertex A are (30; 10) and the coordinates of
vertex Bare (10; 30).

Step 6 : Draw in the search line

The search line is the gradient of the objective function. That is, if the equation
C = dOx + 50y is now written in the standard form y = . . ., then the gradient is:

m = --,

which is shown with the broken line on the graph.

At vertex A, the cost is:

= 60(30) + 50(10)

= 1 800 + 500

= R2 300

At vertex B, the cost is:

C = 60x fc + 50Â»/t

= 60(10) + 50(30)

= 600 + 1500

= R2 100

Step 8 : Write the final answer

The cheapest combination of prizes is 10 kettles and 30 toasters, costing the
company R2 100.

Terminology



EMCBV



The following is a recap of terms that are regularly used when referring to circles.

arc An arc is a part of the circumference of a circle.

chord A chord is a straight line joining the ends of an arc.

radius A radius, r, is any straight line from the centre of the circle to a point on the circumference.

diameter A diameter, 0, is a special chord that passes through the centre of the circle. A diameter is
the length of a straight line segment from one point on the circumference to another point on
the circumference, that passes through the centre of the circle.

segment A segment is the part of the circle that is cut off by a chord. A chord divides a circle into two
segments.

tangent A tangent is a line that makes contact with a circle at one point on the circumference. (AB is
a tangent to the circle at point P) in Figure 9.1.

CHAPTER 9. GEOMETRY

Proof:




Consider a circle, with centre O. Draw a chord AB and draw a perpendicular line from the centre of
the circle to intersect the chord at point P.

The aim is to prove that AP = BP

1 . AOAP and AOBP are right-angled triangles.

2. OA = OB as both of these are radii and OP is common to both triangles.

Apply the Theorem of Pythagoras to each triangle, to get:

OA 2 = OP 2 + AP 2

However, OA = OB. So,

This means that OP bisects AB.

Theorem 2. The line drawn from the centre of a circle, that bisects a chord, is perpendicular to the

Prove that:

1. CFOE is a cyclic quadrilateral

2. FB = BC

3. ACOE///ACBF

4. CD 2 = ED x AD

r OE_ _ C_D

BC CO



SOLUTION



Step 1 : To show a quadrilateral is cyclic, we need a pair of opposite angles to be
supplementary, so let's look for that.



FOE = 90Â° {BO Â± OD)

FCE = 90Â° (Z subtended by diameter AE)

CFOE is a cyclic quadrilateral (opposite Z's supplementary)

Step 2 : Since these two sides are part of a triangle, we are proving that triangle to be
isosceles. The easiest way is to show the angles opposite to those sides to be equal.

Let OEC = x.

FCB = x (Z between tangent BD and chord CE)
BFC = x (exterior Z to cyclic quadrilateral CFOE)
and BF = BC (sides opposite equal Z's in isosceles ABFC)

Step 3 : To show these two triangles similar, we will need 3 equal angles. We already
have 3 of the 6 needed angles from the previous question. We need only find the
missing 3 angles.

CBF = 180Â° - 2x (sum of Z's in ABFC)

OC = OE (radii of circle O)

.-. ECO = x (isosceles ACOE)

.-. COE = 180Â° - 2x (sum of Z's in ACOE)

â€¢ COE = CBF
. ECO = FCB

. OEC = CFB

:. ACOE///ACBF (3 Z's equal)



Step 4 : This relation reminds us of a proportionality relation between similar triangles.
So investigate which triangles contain these sides and prove them similar. In this case 3
equal angles works well. Start with one triangle.



i;;i



CHAPTER 9. GEOMETRY 9.2



In AEDC



CED = 180Â° - x (Z's on a straight line AD)
ECD = 90Â° â€” x (complementary Z's)



Step 5 : Now look at the angles in the other triangle.

In AADC

ACT) = 180Â° - x (sum of Z's ACE and ECD)
CAD = 90Â° - x (sum of Z's in ACAE)



Step 6 : The third equal angle is an angle both triangles have in common.

Lastly, ADC = EDC since they are the same Z.

Step 7 : Now we know that the triangles are similar and can use the proportionality
relation accordingly.



:. AADC 1 1 1 ACDE (3 Z's equal)

ED _ CD
' ' ~CD ~ AD
:. CD 2 = ED x AD

Step 8 : This looks like another proportionality relation with a little twist, since not all
sides are contained in 2 triangles. There is a quick observation we can make about the
odd side out, OE.

OE = OC (AOEC is isosceles)

Step 9 : With this observation we can limit ourselves to proving triangles BOC and
ODC similar. Start in one of the triangles.

In ABCO

OCB = 90Â° (radius OC on tangent BD)
CBO = 180Â° - 2x (sum of Z's in ABFC)
BOC = 2x- 90Â° (sum of Z's in ABCO)



Step 1 : Then we move on to the other one.

In AOCD

OCD = 90Â° (radius OC on tangent BD)
COD = 180Â° - 2x (sum of Z's in AOCE)
CDO = 2x- 90Â° (sum of Z's in AOCD)



Step 1 1 : Then, once we've shown similarity, we use the proportionality relation, as
well as our first observation, appropriately.

.-. Z_FDC = x (alternate Z, FD || CB)

.-. FADE is a cyclic quadrilateral (chord FE subtends equal Z's)

:. ZFDA = y (Z's subtended by same chord AF in cyclic quadrilateral FADE)

Step 3 : We have already proved 1 pair of angles equal in the previous question.

ZBCD = ZFAE (above)



Step 4 : Proving the last set of angles equal is simply a matter of adding up the angles
in the triangles. Then we have proved similarity.



ZAFE = 180Â° -x-y (Z's in AAFE)
ZCDB = 180Â° -x-y (Z's in ACBD)

:. AAFE///ACBD (3 Z's equal)

Step 5 : This equation looks like it has to do with proportionality relation of similar
triangles. We already showed triangles AFE and CBD similar in the previous question.
So lets start there.

Step 6 : Now we need to look for a hint about side FA. Looking at triangle CAH we

line between P and Q. Let the co-ordinates of the centre of the circle be (x ;yo),

Equation of a Tangent to a Circle at a Point ^emcca
on the Circle



We are given that a tangent to a circle is drawn through a point P with co-ordinates (xi;yi). In this
section, we find out how to determine the equation of that tangent.



(a>i ;ift)




Figure 9.4: Circle h with centre (x ;yo) has a tangent, g passing through point P at (xi;yi). Line /
passes through the centre and point P.

We start by making a list of what we know:

1. We know that the equation of the circle with centre (xo;yo) and radius r is (2 â€” x ) 2 + (yâ€” yo) 2 =
r 2 .

2. We know that a tangent is perpendicular to the radius, drawn at the point of contact with the
circle.

As we have seen in earlier grades, there are two steps to determining the equation of a straight line:

Step 1 : Calculate the gradient of the line, m.
Step 2: Calculate the ^-intercept of the line, c.

The same method is used to determine the equation of the tangent. First we need to find the gradient
of the tangent. We do this by finding the gradient of the line that passes through the centre of the circle
and point P (line / in Figure 9.4), because this line is a radius and the tangent is perpendicular to it.

In this chapter we will build on the trigonometry from previous years by looking at the result applying
trigonometric functions to sums and differences of angles. We will also apply trigonometry to solving
geometric problems in two and three dimensions.

10.2 Compound Angle Identities




Derivation of sin (a + (5)



EMCCG



We have, for any angles a and 0, that



sin(a + 0) = sin a cos + sin /3 cos a



How do we derive this identity? It is tricky, so follow closely.



Suppose we have the unit circle shown below. The two points L(a; b) and K(x; y) are on the circle.



148



CHAPTER 10. TRIGONOMETRY



10.2



K(x;y)



L(a:b)




We can get the coordinates of L and K in terms of the angles a and 0. For the triangle LOM, we have
that



sin /3 = â€”

a a

cos p = â€”



b = sin /3
a = cos /3



Thus the coordinates of L are (cos /3; sin /3). In the same way as above, we can see that the coordinates
of K are (cos a; sin a). The identity for cos(a â€” /3) is now determined by calculating KI? in two ways.
Using the distance formula (i.e. d = \J\x~i â€” ii) 2 + (2/2 â€” 3/1) 2 or d 2 = (x 2 â€” xi) 2 + (y 2 â€” yi) 2 ), we
can find KL 2 :

KL = (cos a â€” cos/3) + (sin a â€” sin/3)

= cos a â€” 2 cos a cos /3 + cos /3 + sin a â€” 2 sin a sin /3 + sin /3
= (cos a + sin a) + (cos /3 + sin /3) â€” 2 cos a cos /3 â€” 2 sin a sin /3
= 1 + 1 â€” 2(cos a cos /3 + sin a sin /3)
= 2 â€” 2(cosacos/3 + sinasin/3)
The second way we can determine KL 2 is by using the cosine rule for AKOL:
KL 2 = KO 2 + LO 2 -2.KO.LO. cos(a - 0)
= 1 2 + l 2 -2(l)(l)cos(a-/3)
= 2 - 2 . cos(a - 13)
Equating our two values for KL 2 , we have

2 â€” 2 . cos(a â€” /3) = 2 â€” 2(cosacos/3 + sin a . sin/3)
^=> cos(a â€” /3) = cos a . cos /3 + sin a . sin /3
Now let a â€” > 90Â° â€” a. Then

cos(90Â° - a - /3) = cos(90Â° - a) cos /3 + sin(90Â° -a)sin/3
= sin a . cos /3 + cos a . sin /3
But cos(90Â° - (a + /3)) = sin(a + /3). Thus

sin(a + /3) = sin a . cos /3 + cos a . sin /3

sin(a â€” 0) = sin a cos â€” cos a sin

sin(-fl) = -sin(0)

sin(a - /3) = sin(a + (-Â£))

Therefore,



sin(a â€” 0) = sin a cos â€” sin cos a

Derivation of cos (a - /3)



EMCCJ



We found this identity in our derivation of the sin(o + 0) identity. We can also use the fact that

sin(ct + 0) = sin a cos + cos a sin

When a = /9, we have that

Tip


When


proving trigono-

identities, never


assume that the [eft hand


side is


equal to the right


hand side. You need to


show that both sides are


equal.





The most important thing to remember when asked to prove identities is:

A suggestion for proving identities: It is usually much easier simplifying the more complex side of an
identity to get the simpler side than the other way round.



Example 1: Trigonometric Identities 1



QUESTION


Prove that sin 75Â° = (v ^ 3+1) without using a calculator.


SOLUTION




Step 1 : Identify a strategy

We only know the exact values of the trig functions for a few special angles (30Â°;


45Â°; 60Â°; etc.). We


can see that 75Â° = 30Â° + 45Â°. Thus we can use our double-


angle identity for sin(a + 0) to express sin 75Â° in terms of known trig function
values.


Step 2 : Execute strategy

QUESTION



Deduce a formula tor tan(a + 0) in terms of tana and tan/3.
Hint: Use the formulae tor sin(a + 0) and cos(a + 0)



SOLUTION



Step 1 : Identify a strategy

We can express tan(a + 0) in terms of cosines and sines, and then use the
double-angle formulae for these. We then manipulate the resulting expression in
order to get it in terms of tana and tan/3.



Step 2 : Execute strategy

Example 3: Trigonometric Identities 3



QUESTION



Prove that

sin 6 + sin 20

â€” - = tan

1 + cos 9 + cos 20

In fact, this identity is not valid for all values of 9. Which values are those?



SOLUTION



Step 1 : Identify a strategy

The right-hand side (RHS) of the identity cannot be simplified. Thus we should
try simplify the left-hand side (LHS). We can also notice that the trig function on
the RHS does not have a 29 dependence. Thus we will need to use the double-
angle formulae to simplify the sin 20 and cos 29 on the LHS. We know that tan#



l.VS



70.2 CHAPTER 10. TRIGONOMETRY



is undefined for some angles 9. Thus the identity is also undefined for these 9,
and hence is not valid for these angles. Also, for some 9, we might have division
by zero in the LHS, which is not allowed. Thus the identity won't hold for these
angles also.



Step 2 : Execute the strategy

sin 9 + 2 sin 9 cos I
LHS



1 + cos 9 + (2 cos 2 9 - 1)
sin6Â»(l + 2cos#)
cos6Â»(l + 2cos6>)
sin 9
cos 9
tan 9

RHS



We know that tan 6 is undefined when 9 = 90Â° + 180Â°n, where n is an integer.
The LHS is undefined when 1 + cos 9 + cos 29 = 0. Thus we need to solve this
equation.

1 + cos 9 + cos 29 =
=>â€¢ cos6Â»(l + 2cos6Â») =



The above has solutions when cos9 = 0, which occurs when 9 = 90Â° + 180Â°n,
where n is an integer. These are the same values when tan# is undefined. It
also has solutions when 1 + 2 cos 9 = 0. This is true when cos 9 = â€” \, and thus
9 = ... - 240Â°, -120Â°, 120Â°, 240Â°, .... To summarise, the identity is not valid
when 9 = ... - 270Â° ; -240Â° ; - 120Â° ; -90Â° ; 90Â° ; 120Â° ; 240Â° ; 270Â° ; . . .



Example 4: Trigonometric Equations



QUESTION



Solve the following equation for y without using a calculator:

1 â€” sin y â€” cos 2y

Before we are able to solve the equation, we first need to simplify the left-hand
side. We do this by using the double-angle formulae.

CHAPTER 10. TRIGONOMETRY




SOLUTION



Step 7 : Identify a strategy

We want CB, and we have CD and BD. If we could get the angle BDC,
then we could use the cosine rule to determine BC. This is possible, as AABD
is a right-angled triangle. We know this from circle geometry, that any triangle
circumscribed by a circle with one side going through the origin, is right-angled.
As we have two angles of AABD, we know ADB and hence BDC. Using the
cosine rule, we can get BC 2 .



Step 2 : Execute the strategy



Thus



ADB = 180Â°



BDC



90



: 90Â° - e



180Â° - ADB
= 180Â° - (90Â° - 0)
= 90Â° +

Now the cosine rule gives

BC 2 = CD 2 + BD 2 -2.CD.BD. cos(BDC)

= x 2 + x 2 - 2 . x 2 . cos(90Â° + 0)

= 2x 2 + 2x 2 [sin(90Â°) cos(0) + sin(0) cos(90Â°)]

= 2x 2 + 2x 2 [ 1 . cos(0) + sin(6>) . 0]

CHAPTER 10. TRIGONOMETRY 10.3



Step 1 : Identify a strategy

We have that the triangle ABD is right-angled. Thus we can relate the height
h with the angle a and either the length BA or BD (using sines or cosines).
But we have two angles and a length for ABCD, and thus can work out all the
remaining lengths and angles of this triangle. We can thus work out BD.

Step 2 : Execute the strategy

We have that

h

10.4 Other Geometries




Taxi cab Geometry



EMCCR



Taxicab geometry, considered by Hermann Minkowski in the 19th century, is a form of geometry in
which the usual metric of Euclidean geometry is replaced by a new metric in which the distance
between two points is the sum of the (absolute) differences of their coordinates.



Manhattan Distance



EMCCS



The metric in taxi-cab geometry, is known as the Manhattan distance, between two points in an
Euclidean space with fixed Cartesian coordinate system as the sum of the lengths of the projections of
the line segment between the points onto the coordinate axes.



Kid



CHAPTER 10. TRIGONOMETRY

case the Manhattan distance is 12 units, while the Euclidean distance is a/36



The Manhattan distance changes if the coordinate system is rotated, but does not depend on the
translation of the coordinate system or its reflection with respect to a coordinate axis.



Manhattan distance is also known as city block distance or taxi-cab distance. It is given these names
because it is the shortest distance a car would drive in a city laid out in square blocks.



Taxicab geometry satisfies all of Euclid's axioms except for the side-angle-side axiom, as one can
generate two triangles with two sides and the angle between them the same and have them not be
congruent. In particular, the parallel postulate holds.



A circle in taxicab geometry consists of those points that are a fixed Manhattan distance from the
centre. These circles are squares whose sides make a 45Â° angle with the coordinate axes.

If large numbers of data are collected from a population, the graph will often have a bell shape. If the
data was, say, examination results, a few learners usually get very high marks, a few very low marks
and most get a mark in the middle range. We say a distribution is normal if



the mean, median and mode are equal.



it is symmetric around the mean.



Â±68% of the sample lies within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% within two standard
deviations and 99% within three standard deviations of the mean.

What happens if the test was very easy or very difficult? Then the distribution may not be symmetrical.
If extremely high or extremely low scores are added to a distribution, then the mean tends to shift
towards these scores and the curve becomes skewed.



If the test was very difficult, the mean score is shifted to the
left. In this case, we say the distribution is positively skewed,
or skewed right.



If it was very easy, then many learners would get high scores,
and the mean of the distribution would be shifted to the right.
We say the distribution is negatively skewed, or skewed left.

11.3 Extracting a Sample
Population




Suppose you are trying to find out what percentage of South Africa's population owns a car. One way
of doing this might be to send questionnaires to peoples homes, asking them whether they own a car.
However, you quickly run into a problem: you cannot hope to send every person in the country a
questionnaire, it would be far to expensive. Also, not everyone would reply. The best you can do is
send it to a few people, see what percentage of these own a car, and then use this to estimate what
percentage of the entire country own cars. This smaller group of people is called the sample popula-
tion.

The sample population must be carefully chosen, in order to avoid biased results. How do we do

this?

First, it must be representative. If all of our sample population comes from a very rich area, then almost

all will have cars. But we obviously cannot conclude from this that almost everyone in the country has

a car! We need to send the questionnaire to rich as well as poor people.

Secondly, the size of the sample population must be large enough. It is no good having a sample

population consisting of only two people, for example. Both may very well not have cars. But we

obviously cannot conclude that no one in the country has a car! The larger the sample population

size, the more likely it is that the statistics of our sample population corresponds to the statistics of the

entire population.



166



CHAPTER 11. STATISTICS



11.4



So how does one ensure that ones sample is representative? There are a variety of methods avail-
able, which we will look at now.



Random Sampling. Every person in the country has an equal chance of being selected. It is
unbiased and also independent, which means that the selection of one person has no effect on
the selection on another. One way of doing this would be to give each person in the country a
number, and then ask a computer to give us a list of random numbers. We could then send the
questionnaire to the people corresponding to the random numbers.

Systematic Sampling. Again give every person in the country a number, and then, for example,
select every hundredth person on the list. So person with number 1 would be selected, person
with number 100 would be selected, person with number 200 would be selected, etc.

Stratified Sampling. We consider different subgroups of the population, and take random sam-
ples from these. For example, we can divide the population into male and female, different ages,
or into different income ranges.

Cluster Sampling. Here the sample is concentrated in one area. For example, we consider all
the people living in one urban area.



Exercise 11-2



1 . Discuss the advantages, disadvantages and possible bias when using

(a) systematic sampling

(b) random sampling

(c) cluster sampling

2. Suggest a suitable sampling method that could be used to obtain information on:

(a) passengers views on availability of a local taxi service.

(b) views of learners on school meals.

(c) defects in an item made in a factory.

(d) medical costs of employees in a large company.

3. 2% of a certain magazines' subscribers is randomly selected. The random number 16 out of 50,
is selected. Then subscribers with numbers 16; 66; 116; 166; ... are chosen as a sample. What
kind of sampling is this?

7 1 .4 Function Fitting and
Regression Analysis



In Grade 1 1 we recorded two sets of data (bivariate data) on a scatter plot and then we drew a line of
best fit as close to as many of the data items as possible. Regression analysis is a method of finding



107



7 7.4



CHAPTER 11. STATISTICS



out exactly which function best fits a given set of data. We can find out the equation of the regression
line by drawing and estimating, or by using an algebraic method called "the least squares method",
available on most scientific calculators. The linear regression equation is written y = a + bx (we say
y-hat) or y = A + Bx. Of course these are both variations of a more familiar equation y = mx + c.

Suppose you are doing an experiment with washing dishes. You count how many dishes you begin
with, and then find out how long it takes to finish washing them. So you plot the data on a graph of
time taken versus number of dishes. This is plotted below.




* d



2 3 4 5

Number of dishes



If t is the time taken, and d the number of dishes, then it looks as though t is proportional to d, ie.
t = m .d, where m is the constant of proportionality. There are two questions that interest us now.

1 . How do we find m? One way you have already learnt, is to draw a line of best-fit through the
data points, and then measure the gradient of the line. But this is not terribly precise. Is there a
better way of doing it?

2. How well does our line of best fit really fit our data? If the points on our plot don't all lie close to
the line of best fit, but are scattered everywhere, then the fit is not "good", and our assumption
that t = m .d might be incorrect. Can we find a quantitative measure of how well our line really
fits the data?

In this chapter, we answer both of these questions, using the techniques of regression analysis. Â® See

that y = 3,5 when x = 3. So we have that points (3; 3,5) and (0: 1,5) lie on the


line. The gradient of the line, m, is given by

The Method of Least Squares



EMCCY



We now come to a more accurate method of finding the line of best-fit. The method is very simple.
Suppose we guess a line of best-fit. Then at at every data point, we find the distance between the
data point and the line. If the line fitted the data perfectly, this distance should be zero for all the data
points. The worse the fit, the larger the differences. We then square each of these distances, and add



l(i<)



7 7.4



CHAPTER 11. STATISTICS



them all together.



The best-fit line is then the line that minimises the sum of the squared distances.
Suppose we have a data set of n points {(#1; 3/1), (x 2 ; 2/2), . . . , (xâ€ž; y n )}. We also have a line f(x) =
mx + c that we are trying to fit to the data. The distance between the first data point and the line, for
example, is

distance = y\ â€” /(si) = y\ â€” (mx\ + c)

We now square each of these distances and add them together. Lets call this sum S(m,c). Then we
have that



S(m,c)



(Vi - f(xi)f + (V2 - f(x 2 )) 2 + .s + (y n - f{x n )f



X> - f {x ^



Thus our problem is to find the value of m and c such that S(m,c) is minimised. Let us call these
minimising values m and c a . Then the line of best-fit is f(x) = m x + Co. We can find m and c
using calculus, but it is tricky, and we will just give you the result, which is that

Correlation Coefficients



EMCDA



Once we have applied regression analysis to a set of data, we would like to have a number that tells
us exactly how well the data fits the function. A correlation coefficient, r, is a tool that tells us to what
degree there is a relationship between two sets of data. The correlation coefficient r e [â€”1; 1] when
r = â€” 1, there is a perfect negative correlation, when r = 0, there is no correlation and r = 1 is a
perfect positive correlation.



Positive, strong Positive, fairly strong Positive, weak

r sa 0,9 r Â« 0,7 r ss 0,4



No association Negative, fairly strong

r = rss â€”0,7



We often use the correlation coefficient r 2 in order to examine the strength of the correlation only.
In this case:



r 2 =0

Combinations and
Permutations





1 2. 1 Introduction




Mathematics education began with counting. In the beginning, fingers, beans and buttons were used
to help with counting, but these are only practical for small numbers. What happens when a large
number of items must be counted?

This chapter focuses on how to use mathematical techniques to count combinations of items.

Â© See introductory video: VMidw at www.everythingmaths.co.za




12.2 Counting




An important aspect of probability theory is the ability to determine the total number of possible
outcomes when multiple events are considered.

For example, what is the total number of possible outcomes when a die is rolled and then a coin is
tossed? The roll of a die has six possible outcomes (1; 2; 3; 4; 5 or 6) and the toss of a coin, 2 outcomes
(head or tails). Counting the possible outcomes can be tedious.



Making a List



EMCDD



The simplest method of counting the total number of outcomes is by making a list:

1H; IT; 2H; 2T; 3H; ST; AH; AT; 5H; 5T; 6H; 6T
or drawing up a table:

Both these methods result in 12 possible outcomes, but both these methods have a lot of repetition.
Maybe there is a smarter way to write down the result?



Tree Diagrams



EMCDE



One method of eliminating some of the repetition is to use tree diagrams. Tree diagrams are a graphical
method of listing all possible combinations of events from a random experiment.

EMCDG



For an integer n, the notation n! (read n factorial) represents:

n x (n â€” 1) x (n â€” 2) x â–  â–  â–  x 3 x 2 x 1
with the following definition: 0! = 1.
The factorial notation will be used often in this chapter.





12.4 Fundamental Counting
Principle



The use of lists, tables and tree diagrams is only feasible for events with a few outcomes. When the
number of outcomes grows, it is not practical to list the different possibilities and the fundamental
counting principle is used.

The fundamental counting principle describes how to determine the total number of outcomes of a
series of events.

Suppose that two experiments take place. The first experiment has n\ possible outcomes, and the
second has n 2 possible outcomes. Therefore, the first experiment, followed by the second experiment,

12.5



CHAPTER 12. COMBINATIONS AND PERMUTATIONS



will have a total of rn x n 2 possible outcomes. This idea can be generalised to m experiments as the
total number of outcomes for m experiments is:



n\ X n2 X ri3 X â–  â–  â–  X nâ€ž



IL



Yl is the multiplication equivalent of ^2-

Note: the order in which the experiments are done does not affect the total number of possible out-
comes.



Example 1: Lunch Special



QUESTION



A take-away has a 4-piece lunch special which consists of a sandwich, soup, dessert and drink

for R25,00. They offer the following choices for :

Sandwich: chicken mayonnaise, cheese and tomato, tuna, and ham and lettuce

Soup: tomato, chicken noodle, vegetable

Dessert: ice-cream, piece of cake

Drink: tea, coffee, coke, Fanta and Sprite.

How many possible meals are there?



SOLUTION



Step 1 : Determine how many parts to the meal there are

There are 4 parts: sandwich, soup, dessert and drink.

Step 2 : Identify how many choices there are for each part



Meal component

Step 3 : Use the fundamental counting principle to determine how many different meals
are possible



4x3x2x5 = 120
So there are 120 possible meals.




12.5 Combinations




The fundamental counting principle describes how to calculate the total number of outcomes when
multiple independent events are performed together.

CHAPTER 12. COMBINATIONS AND PERMUTATIONS 12.5



A more complex problem is determining how many combinations there are of selecting a group of
objects from a set. Mathematically, a combination is defined as an un-ordered collection of unique
elements, or more formally, a subset of a set. For example, suppose you have fifty-two playing cards,
and select five cards. The five cards would form a combination and would be a subset of the set of 52
cards.

In a set, the order of the elements in the set does not matter. These are represented usually with curly
braces. For example {2; 4; 6} is a subset of the set {1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6}. Since the order of the elements
does not matter, only the specific elements are of interest. Therefore,

{2; 4; 6} = {6; 4; 2}

and {1; 1; 1} is the same as {1} because in a set the elements don't usually appear more than once.

So in summary we can say the following: Given S, the set of all possible unique elements, a combina-
tion is a subset of the elements of S. The order of the elements in a combination is not important (two
lists with the same elements in different orders are considered to be the same combination). Also, the
elements cannot be repeated in a combination (every element appears once).




Calculating the number of ways that certain patterns can be formed is the beginning of combinatorics,
the study of combinations. Let S be a set with n objects. Combinations of r objects from this set S are
subsets of S having r elements each (where the order of listing the elements does not distinguish two
subsets).



Combination Without Repetition

When the order does not matter, but each object can be chosen only once, the number of combinations
is:



r\(n â€” r)\ \r

where n is the number of objects from which you can choose and r is the number to be chosen.

For example, if you have 10 numbers and wish to choose 5 you would have 10!/(5!(10 â€” 5)!) = 252
ways to choose.

For example how many possible 5 card hands are there in a deck of cards with 52 cards?

52!/(5!(52 - 5)!) = 2 598 960 combinations



Combination with Repetition

When the order does not matter and an object can be chosen more than once, then the number of
combinations is:



(ra + r â€” 1)! In + r â€” l\ ln + r â€” 1



r\(n â€” 1)! I r J In â€” 1

where n is the number of objects from which you can choose and r is the number to be chosen.

For example, if you have ten types of donuts to choose from and you want three donuts there are
(10 + 3 â€” 1)!/3!(10 â€” 1)! = 220 ways to choose. See video: VMihd at www.everythingmaths.co.za

Combinatorics and Probability



EMCDK



Combinatorics is quite useful in the computation of probabilities of events, as it can be used to deter-
mine exactly how many outcomes are possible in a given experiment.



Example 2: Probability



QUESTION



At a school, learners each play 2 sports. They can choose from netball, basketball, soccer,
athletics, swimming, or tennis. What is the probability that a learner plays soccer and either
netball, basketball or tennis?



SOLUTION



Step 1 : Identify what events we are counting

We count the events: soccer and netball, soccer and basketball, soccer and
tennis. This gives three choices.

Step 2 : Calculate the total number of choices

There are 6 sports to choose from and we choose 2 sports. There are
Q =6!/(2!(6-2)!) = 15 choices.

Step 3 : Calculate the probability

The probability is the number of events we are counting, divided by the total
number of choices.
Probability = Â± = | = 0,2




12.6 Permutations




The concept of a combination did not consider the order of the elements of the subset to be important.
A permutation is a combination with the order of a selection from a group being important. For
example, for the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, the combination {1,2,3} would be identical to the combination
{3, 2, 1}, but these two combinations are different permutations, because the elements in the set are
ordered differently.

More formally, a permutation is an ordered list without repetitions, perhaps missing some elements.

This means that {1; 2; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6} and {1; 2; 4; 5; 5; 6} are not permutations of the set {1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6}.



182



CHAPTER 12. COMBINATIONS AND PERMUTATIONS 12.6

Now suppose you have these objects:

1;2;3

Here is a list of all permutations of all three objects:

12 3; 13 2; 2 13; 2 3 1; 3 12; 3 2 1.



Counting Permutations wemcdm



Let 5 be a set with n objects. Permutations of r objects from this set S refer to sequences of r different
elements of S (where two sequences are considered different if they contain the same elements but
in a different order). Formulae for the number of permutations and combinations are readily available
and important throughout combinatorics.

It is easy to count the number of permutations of size r when chosen from a set of size n (with r < n).

1 . Select the first member of the permutation out of n choices, because there are n distinct elements
in the set.

2. Next, since one of the n elements has already been used, the second member of the permutation
has (n â€” 1) elements to choose from the remaining set.

3. The third member of the permutation can be filled in (n â€” 2) ways since 2 have been used
already.

4. This pattern continues until there are r members on the permutation. This means that the last
member can be filled in (n â€” (r â€” 1)) = (n â€” r + 1) ways.

5. Summarising, we find that there is a total of

n(n - l)(n - 2) â€¢â€¢ â€¢ (n â€” r + 1)

different permutations of r objects, taken from a pool of n objects. This number is denoted by
P(n, r) and can be written in factorial notation as:

P(n,r)



(n â€” r)\



For example, if we have a total of 5 elements, the integers {1; 2; 3; 4; 5}, how many ways are there for
a permutation of three elements to be selected from this set? In this case, n = 5 and r = 3. Then,
P(5,3) = 5!/7! = 60!.

CHAPTER 12. COMBINATIONS AND PERMUTATIONS



QUESTION



Show that a collection of n objects has n\ permutations.



SOLUTION



Proof: Constructing an ordered sequence of n objects is equivalent to choosing the position
occupied by the first object, then choosing the position of the second object, and so on, until
we have chosen the position of each of our n objects.

There are n ways to choose a position for the first object. Once its position is fixed, we
can choose from (n â€” 1) possible positions for the second object. With the first two placed,
there are (n â€” 2) remaining possible positions for the third object; and so on. There are only
two positions to choose from for the penultimate object, and the nth object will occupy the
last remaining position.

Therefore, according to the fundamental counting principle, there are

n(n- l)(n-2) â–  â–  â–  2 x 1 = n\
ways of constructing an ordered sequence of n objects.



Permutation with Repetition

When order matters and an object can be chosen more than once then the number of
permutations is:

n

where n is the number of objects from which you can choose and r is the number to be chosen.

For example, if you have the letters A, B, C, and D and you wish to discover the number of ways of
arranging them in three letter patterns (trigrams) you find that there are 4 3 or 64 ways. This is because
for the first slot you can choose any of the four values, for the second slot you can choose any of the
four, and for the final slot you can choose any of the four letters. Multiplying them together gives the
total.

The Binomial Theorem



In mathematics, the binomial theorem is an important formula giving the expansion of powers
of sums. Its simplest version reads



/ \n \~^ / n \ k n-k

(x+ y ) =2^\ k \ x y

k = ' '



181



CHAPTER 12. COMBINATIONS AND PERMUTATIONS 12.7



Whenever n is a positive integer, the numbers



k k\(n-k)\

are the binomial coefficients (the coefficients in front of the powers).
For example, here are the cases n = 2, n = 3 and n = 4:



(x + %i) = x + Ixy + y



(x + yf = x 3 + 3x 2 y + 3xy 2 + y 3

I i \4 4 . ,. 3 ,Â«22.^ 3, 4

(a; + y) = x + 4x y + bx y + 4xy + j/



The coefficients form a triangle, where each number
is the sum of the two numbers above it:



This formula and the triangular arrangement of the binomial coefficients, are often at-
tributed to Blaise Pascal who described them in the 17th century. It was, however, known
to the Chinese mathematician Yang Hui in the 1 3th century, the earlier Persian mathematician
Omar Khayym in the 1 1th century, and the even earlier Indian mathematician Pingala in the
3rd century BC.



Example 4: Number Plates



QUESTION



The number plate on a car consists of any 3 letters of the alphabet (excluding the vowels and
'Q'), followed by any 3 digits (0 to 9). For a car chosen at random, what is the probability that
the number plate starts with a 'Y' and ends with an odd digit?



SOLUTION



Step 1 : Identify what events are counted

The number plate starts with a 'Y', so there is only 1 choice for the first letter,
and ends with an odd digit, so there are 5 choices for the last digit (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).

Step 2 : Find the number of events

Use the counting principle. For each of the other letters, there are 20 possible
choices (26 in the alphabet, minus 5 vowels and 'Q') and 10 possible choices for
each of the other digits.
Number of events = 1 x 20 x 20 x 10 x 10 x 5 = 200 000

Step 3 : Find the number of total number of possible number plates

Use the counting principle. This time, the first letter and last digit can be any-
thing.
Total number of choices = 20 x 20 x 20 x 10 x 10 x 10 = 8 000 000

Step 4 : Calculate the probability

The probability is the number of events we are counting, divided by the total
number of choices.
